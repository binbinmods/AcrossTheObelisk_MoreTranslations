e_aquar11_a_nm=Jack, the boat seller
e_aquar11_a_dsc=On the south pier, you find a boat sales stand. When you approach, a crocoman appears behind the counter and says:<br><br>"Hello travelers, if you want a boat to navigate the marsh, this is the best store in the area. I am Jack, a seller affiliated with the global merchants association, and I always offer the best prices, whatever some may say.<br><br>The price of a boat is 800g."
e_aquar11_a_dsca=Do you want to buy a boat?
e_aquar11_a_rp0=You don't want to buy anything.
e_aquar11_a_rp0_s=You say goodbye to Jack and go on your way.
e_aquar11_a_rp1=You pay the 800g to buy a boat.
e_aquar11_a_rp1_s=After receiving the 800g, Jack goes to the pier and prepares a boat for you.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.
e_aquar11_a_rp2=Try to get it for 500g or you won't buy it.
e_aquar11_a_rp2_s=Seeing that he doesn't seem to have many customers, you manage to convince him to let you have a boat for 500g.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.
e_aquar11_a_rp2_f=Being a crocoman, he is stubborn, and you do not convince him to lower the price of the boat.<br><br>Since you don't have much else to do, you leave.
e_aquar11_a_rp2_sc=After talking to him for a while, he likes you and gives you a boat for 300g.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.
e_aquar11_a_rp2_fc=The crocoman doesn't take your bargaining offer very well, and asks you to leave the pier before he calls his friends.<br><br>You leave rather humiliated after your attempt to bargain.
e_aquar11_a_rp3=Show the VIP card and pay 400g for the boat.
e_aquar11_a_rp3_s=You show the card to Jack, and he immediately offers you a 50% discount. You pay the 400g, and he prepares a boat for you.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.
e_aquar11_a_rp4=Tell him Irwin sent you for a free boat.
e_aquar11_a_rp4_s=Jack immediately recognizes Irwin's name as the crocomen leader and his boss. You tell him how you helped conquer the battlefield, and he promised you a boat. Without thinking twice, Jack goes to the dock and prepares a boat for you.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the swamp.
e_aquar13_a_nm=A tough choice
e_aquar13_a_dsc=You arrive at a ravine full of cobwebs and cocoons. Some of the cocoons seem freshly made.<br><br>As you get closer, the cocoons start to shake... There are people inside! The trapped people start screaming when they hear you, begging you to release them.<br><br>You hesitate, as some of them may be starting to mutate, and you can't be sure what their condition is.
e_aquar13_a_dsca=What do you want to do?
e_aquar13_a_rp0=Ignore the cocoons and go your way.
e_aquar13_a_rp0_s=You leave the place and hear the screaming stop.
e_aquar13_a_rp1=Release the people by opening the cocoons.
e_aquar13_a_rp1_s=First you open the freshest cocoons and release a couple of humans, who both seem healthy. They thank you for what you have done, and one of them places a strange coin in your hand before leaving.<br><br>You open more cocoons, but in these you find two more people who have already mutated. They attack you instantly, and you defend yourself the best you can.
e_aquar13_a_rp2=Kill them without opening the cocoons to spare them from suffering.
e_aquar13_a_rp2_s=You cannot risk opening the cocoons, so you will show mercy and end the suffering of those who are mutating. You use your weapons to pierce the cocoons and kill them.<br><br>This has been an experience that you will not forget.
e_aquar13_a_rp3=Kill them then open the cocoons to loot.
e_aquar13_a_rp3_s=You use your weapons to pierce the cocoons and kill what's inside, then you open them and see some corpses with some useful items and gold.<br><br>As you loot, the other cocoons open by themselves and some mutants appear, immediately attacking you.
e_aquar14_a_nm=Well deserved rest
e_aquar14_a_dsc=You have left the lands of the lizardmen and crocomen behind and are already halfway to the obelisk.<br><br>The area ahead looks even more dangerous, and you can clearly see many spider webs and pools of poison.
e_aquar14_a_dsca=This seems like a good place to rest before continuing.
e_aquar14_a_rp0=Rest and recover some strength.
e_aquar14_a_rp0_s=You feel refreshed.
e_aquar14_a_rp1=You're fine. You look around for shards.
e_aquar14_a_rp1_s=You found many magic shards among some cobwebs. You also found some gold.

e_aquar14_a_rp1_fc=You haven't found anything and have no more time to keep looking.
e_aquar14_a_rp2=I can take care of an injury and try to heal us.
e_aquar14_a_rp2_s=You have time to treat one injury and heal a bit.<br><br>You can remove one card for free from each hero.

e_aquar16_a_nm=The spiders' cave
e_aquar16_a_dsc=You arrive at the entrance to a cave full of cobwebs. It is obvious that all the spiders you have been killing came from this cave.<br><br>You enter the cave, hoping that it has an exit to the other side.<br><br>As you enter, the ground below you begins to collapse.
e_aquar16_a_dsca=You have to try something to avoid falling.
e_aquar16_a_rp0=Try to jump forward together.
e_aquar16_a_rp0_s=You all fall to safety as the ground collapses behind you.<br><br>You get used to the dim light inside the cave and move on.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp0_sc=You all fall to safety as the ground collapses behind you.<br><br>You get used to the dim light inside the cave and find some magical shards that have been exposed by the collapse.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp0_f=Some of you do not use enough strength in the jump, and you all fall along with the collapsing floor.<br><br>Luckily, you land on your feet and are not hurt.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp0_fc=Some of you do not use enough force in the jump, and you all fall down along with the collapsing ground.<br><br>When landing, you fall badly and break a bone.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp1=Quickly, grab this rope!
e_aquar16_a_rp1_s=Sylvie reacts instantly and shoots a grappling hook arrow that sticks in the ceiling of the cave.<br><br>Thanks to this, you all avoid falling and reach the solid ground on the other side.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp2=Quick, follow in my footsteps!
e_aquar16_a_rp2_s=Zek has no trouble seeing in the dark and traces a route across the still stable ground before it collapses. The others follow and reach the other side without much trouble.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp3=Wait here. Do not advance!
e_aquar16_a_rp3_s=The group stops where Thuls indicated, and most of the ground collapses, except for that part and a small ledge next to the cave wall. You advance along it to the other side.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_b_nm=rptd_e_aquar16_a_nm
e_aquar16_b_dsc=You arrive at the entrance to a cave full of cobwebs. It is obvious that all the spiders you have been killing came from this cave.<br><br>This is undoubtedly the cave that the figure in the shadows of Senenthia's watermill spoke of.

e_aquar18_a_nm=Altar of songs
e_aquar18_a_dsc=In the southern temple, you see an ancient altar that still seems to have some energy. You hear a soft tone emanating from it.<br><br>Before making an offering, you look around and see a few sirens in the water watching you.<br><br>Everything makes you think that the sirens use this altar, and that it reacts to the sound of their voices.
e_aquar18_a_dsca=Do you want to make an offering?
e_aquar18_a_rp0=Before the sirens get angry, you leave.
e_aquar18_a_rp0_s=You walk away.
e_aquar18_a_rp1=Make a quick offering just as the altar is.
e_aquar18_a_rp1_s=Trying not to anger the sirens, you approach and make a simple offering to the altar.<br><br>As the altar already had some energy saved, you can use it with a discount.
e_aquar18_a_rp2=I will sing a song that I know to overload it
e_aquar18_a_rp2_s=Andrin sings a lullaby from his childhood and tries to match it with the soft tone emanating from the altar.<br><br>Surprisingly, it works. The altar is brimming with energy and offers you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade one card for free for each hero.
e_aquar18_a_rp2_f=Andrin sings a tavern song and does not worry at all about trying to make it resemble the soft tone emanating from the altar.<br><br>The altar loses what little energy it had left, and the infuriated sirens come out of the water and attack you.
e_aquar18_a_rp3=I'll sing a song I know from my homeland
e_aquar18_a_rp3_s=Sylvie sings an elven song with her beautiful voice and effortlessly combines it with the soft tone emanating from the altar.<br><br>It works as expected. The altar is full of energy and offers you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade one card for free for each hero.

The altar is full of energy and offers you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade one card for free for each hero.
e_aquar18_a_rp5=You sing the ancient song you learned at the owl sanctuary.
e_aquar18_a_rp5_s=You sing the ancient song in chorus.<br><br>Suddenly, the altar shines and overflows with energy like never before, offering you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade two cards for free for each hero.
e_aquar18_a_rp6=Place the harpy egg near the altar.
e_aquar18_a_rp6_s=The soft sound emanating from the altar causes the egg to hatch, and a small harpy emerges from it. Mistaking you for her mother, the young harpy begins to follow you.<br><br>Thanks to the harpy, you notice a small chest behind the altar before you leave.
e_aquar18_a_rp7=I will try to corrupt this altar!
e_aquar18_a_rp7_s=Zek casts a curse on the altar, which starts to glow with a dark aura... You can use the altar to try to corrupt one card for each hero.<br><br>Reacting too late to stop him, the nearby sirens leave.
e_aquar18_a_rp7_f=Zek casts a spell on the altar, but it does nothing.<br><br>The altar loses what little energy it had left, and the infuriated sirens come out of the water and attack you.
e_aquar20_a_nm=Snake eyes
e_aquar20_a_dsc=In the central temple, there is large stone statue of a snake coiled between the temple columns. Instead of eyes, the snake statue has two large rubies.<br><br>The statue is protected by several naga wardens with tridents, and they're also protecting an offering chest under the head of the statue.<br><br>Luckily, you hid behind a column and no one has yet noticed your presence.
e_aquar20_a_dsca=How do you want to proceed?

e_aquar20_a_rp0_fc=You advance, hiding behind the columns, believing you are hidden. When you're about to exit, you are hit by a lightning bolt from a warden who saw you.<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_aquar20_a_rp1=You want those rubies. Attack head-on.
e_aquar20_a_rp1_s=Determined to get the rubies, you come out from behind the column and attack the nagas who are protecting them.

e_aquar20_a_rp2_s=You succeed and move between columns without being seen. When you are close enough, you attack them from behind.
e_aquar20_a_rp2_sc=You succeed and move between columns without being seen. You are in the best position to ambush them.
e_aquar20_a_rp2_f=As you move between the columns and get closer, you get distracted by the really big rubies. A stormbringer sees you and casts a lightning spell near you that leaves you a bit stunned and alerts the nagas.<br><br>You have to defend yourself.
e_aquar20_a_rp2_fc=As you move between the columns and get closer, you are distracted by the really big rubies. A stormbringer sees you and casts a lightning spell on you that warns the nagas.<br><br>You have to defend yourself.
e_aquar20_b_nm=Need or greed
e_aquar20_b_dsc=You defeated the nagas protecting the chest and the snake statue with ruby eyes.<br><br>For the moment, there are no more nagas left in the temple, but they will soon return.<br><br>In order to get the rubies, you will have to climb up to the statue and remove them. It will also take some time to loot the chest.
e_aquar20_b_dsca=What do you want to do first?
e_aquar20_b_rp0=Climb up for the rubies and leave the chest.
e_aquar20_b_rp0_s=You climb the stone statue and, with effort, manage to remove the first ruby. It's huge! When you go for the second ruby, you notice that the statue starts to move...

e_aquar20_b_rp1=Loot the chest and leave the rubies.
e_aquar20_b_rp1_s=You open the chest and take everything you find of value. You don't want to waste any more time, and leave before more nagas come.

You don't want to be here when that thing wakes up.
e_aquar20_c_nm=Refugees from the deep
e_aquar20_c_dsc=You arrive at the central temple. Here you find many nagas: the old, the young and the wounded.<br><br>Although they see you, most of them are more concerned about what is in the depths of the water. As you approach, four veteran nagas appear and say to you:<br><br>"We don't want any trouble, so we'll let you pass and give you this huge ruby in exchange for leaving us alone. We're even willing to teach one of you a unique naga combat skill."
e_aquar20_c_dsca=It's hard to say no... Who will be the lucky one?
e_aquar20_c_rp0=You slaughter them all mercilessly.
e_aquar20_c_rp0_s=You ignore their requests and throw yourself into the fray, striking blows left and right.<br><br>The four veteran nagas, though wounded, stand in your way.<br><br>When the fight is over, you will mercilessly kill the remaining nagas that have not returned to the water, and take the ruby.
e_aquar20_c_rp1=You ask for something more tangible besides the ruby.
e_aquar20_c_rp1_s=As they are wounded and don't want any more trouble, they accept.<br><br>They give you some gold and some magic items that are no longer of use to them, in addition to the ruby.<br><br>You take them and leave.
e_aquar20_c_rp2=We accept. Teach it to me!

e_aquar23_a_dsca=Since you are here, take a look at her wares.
e_aquar23_a_rp0=You give her the Belphyor's horn.

e_aquar31_a_rp4_s=Grukli has lived in this area for some time and knows the water current. Before entering the water, he warned you to follow him to avoid danger.
e_aquar31_a_rp5=I'm out of here...
e_aquar31_a_rp5_s=As a lizardman, Thuls has no problem overcoming the current and reaching the shore. Luckily...he has the decency to turn around, grab a nearby branch, and help you out.
e_aquar31_a_rp6=I will use a special arrow to help us out!
e_aquar31_a_rp6_s=Sylvie is always ready with several different arrows. She shoots a grappling hook arrow that sticks in a rock, and you use the rope to get out of the stream.
e_aquar31_a_rp6_f=Sylvie is always ready with several different arrows. She shoots a grappling hook arrow that fails to stick in a nearby rock. Luckily she has a second arrow that does stick, and you use the rope to get out of the current.
e_aquar31_a_rp7=Hold on tight to me!
e_aquar31_a_rp7_s=Bree is very tall and really strong. She has no problem overcoming the current, even having to drag you all with her.
e_aquar31_a_rp8=I had a vision of us falling down the waterfall...
e_aquar31_a_rp8_s=Because Nezglekt warned you beforehand, you were able to avoid the worst, and took the right steps to reach the shore.
e_aquar31_a_rp9=Croak... I will sing to calm the waters!
e_aquar31_a_rp9_s=And surprisingly the waters calmed down... Thanks to Gustav's song, you manage to get out of the dangerous current.
e_aquar31_a_rp10=I will freeze the water to create a path!
e_aquar31_a_rp10_s=Evelyn casts a powerful cold spell. The waters freeze instantly, creating a path you use to get out of the current.
e_aquar31_a_rp10_f=Evelyn casts a spell, but it's not strong enough to freeze all the water. Although it's not what she wanted to do, she manages to create a few chunks of ice that help you get out of the current.
e_aquar31_a_rp11=You tied the rope to a column beforehand just in case.
e_aquar31_a_rp11_s=Seeing the waterfall from afar and noticing that the waters didn't seem safe, you tied the rope to a column to make sure you wouldn't be dragged away. It was a good idea.
e_aquar35_a_nm=Lurking in the water
e_aquar35_a_dsc=To reach the obelisk, you have to cross a pond of water. When you approach, you see something moving underneath.<br><br>Suddenly, four snake-shaped heads appear: it's a hydra! Each head looks a little different from the rest, and you take some time to name them according to their characteristics.<br><br>Since it doesn't move, you can decide how to position yourselves and choose which head you want to stand in front of to fight first.
e_aquar35_a_dsca=If you do not attack immediately, the hydra will have time to prepare.
e_aquar35_a_rp0=Stand in front of Hatred and fight against it. This head seems tougher than the others.
e_aquar35_a_rp0_s=You position yourself in such a way that the head you called Hatred is in front of the others.<br><br>By choosing to quickly engage Hatred, the hydra only has time to prepare itself by improving its physical defenses.

e_aquar35_a_rp2_s=You position yourself in such a way that the head you called Malice is in front of the others.<br><br>By choosing to quickly engage Malice, the hydra only has time to prepare itself by improving its mystical defenses.
e_aquar35_a_rp3=Try to rest behind a column before combat.
e_aquar35_a_rp3_s=You manage to rest for a while and regain your strength. By the time you emerge from the column, the hydra has had time to prepare for combat and raise all its defenses.
e_aquar35_a_rp3_sc=You manage to rest for a while and recover all your strength. You are perfectly prepared for combat. When you get out from behind the column, you surprise the hydra, and it does not have time to prepare all its defenses.
e_aquar35_a_rp3_f=You rest for a while, but then one of you accidentally drops their weapon on the ground. The noise alerts Arrogance, who detects you and throws a lightning storm at you. You get out from behind the column and defend yourselves as best you can. The hydra starts the fight fully prepared.
e_aquar35_a_rp3_fc=As you attempt to rest, the Arrogance head detects you and throws a lightning storm at you. You're electrocuted, and the hydra begins the fight fully prepared.
e_aquar35_b_nm=One less headache
e_aquar35_b_dsc=After a hard fight, you manage to defeat the four heads of the hydra!<br><br>Now that you can advance, you discover a large golden chest behind one of the columns.

e_aquar35_b_rp0=You open the golden chest.

e_aquar36_a_dsc=You are in front of the obelisk. Like the Senenthia obelisk, this one is also activated and brimming with energy.<br><br>As you did before, you read the obelisk runes aloud. The obelisk wall warps and distorts, creating a new set of portals.

e_aquar36_tier2_dsca=The end of your quest is near. Which portal do you want to cross?

e_aquar37_a_nm=Evading the patrol
e_aquar37_a_dsc=After setting the village on fire, you head south.<br><br>You soon see that a crocoman patrol has left its usual route and is approaching you. They've seen the smoke and are heading quickly to their village to try to put out the fire.<br><br>They haven't seen you yet, and you can try to hide to avoid combat.
e_aquar37_a_dsca=Do you want to hide?
e_aquar37_a_rp0=Confront them now, when they are disorganized.
e_aquar37_a_rp0_s=The crocomen were so concerned with the smoke that they barely saw you on the road, ready to attack them.
e_aquar37_a_rp1=You try to hide in some nearby bushes.

e_aquar39_a_nm=The wall collapses
e_aquar39_a_dsc=You are passing by a wall that holds back the water from the waterfalls, and it's full of cracks. Suddenly, when you are next to it, the wall starts to give way.<br><br>You have to run as fast as possible or the wall will fall on you. You might even be dragged down by the water current.
e_aquar39_a_dsca=Run, you fools!
e_aquar39_a_rp0=Challenge fate and run quickly.
e_aquar39_a_rp0_s=You run as fast as you can, but the wall is very big and its pieces fall on you. You do your best to dodge them so as not to break any bones, but above all, you protect your head with your arms.<br><br>There is only a small chance of succeeding without getting hurt.
e_aquar39_a_rp0_f=0
e_aquar39_a_rp1=Beep... I will block the wall with my shield.

e_aquar39_b_nm=The master craftsman
e_aquar39_b_dsc=At the edge of the falls, you see an old gnome admiring the view and sighing. You realize that he is Timothy's master.

I left him there, near the wolves, in the hope that he would give up...or get eaten... Well, I guess it's time to go back to the workshop.<br><br>Mmm...

I can't just play with any instrument. It's gotta be stylish. The only lute similar to mine is in the elven mansion where I played some time ago, in Faeborg...
e_aquar42_b_dsca=Think you can get it for me? I will pay for it."

e_faen15_a_dsc=You arrive at a nearby grove of trees, and Bree decides it's a good place to give you a lesson about the forest.<br><br>She is ready to begin the lesson, if you want to hear it.

e_faen15_b_nm=Saving the treants
e_faen15_b_dsc=In a nearby grove you see a humanoid doe. When you approach, it says:<br><br>"Hello, strangers. I am Bree, guardian of the Senenthia forest, and friend of Ylmer... Before he became corrupted, he entrusted me with his seeds, and I came to this forest in the hope that I could plant them. But with the growing cold, I have doubts that they will survive.<br><br>Since I suspect you defeated Ylmer to get here...maybe you could do something for him and me.
e_faen15_b_dsca=I'll give you one of his last seeds if you promise me you'll find a good place to plant it."
e_faen15_b_rp0=You promise Bree that you will protect the seed and find a good place to plant it.
e_faen15_b_rp0_s=Concerned, she entrusts you with one of the few remaining Ylmer seeds.<br><br>Before you leave, she also gives you some magic shards and tells you that she will stay here for a while to make sure the seed can withstand the cold.<br><br>Later, if you plant the seed in a safe place, she will return to the Senentia forest and be willing to help you in the future if you need her help.
e_faen15_b_rp1=You remind me of her... Um, anyway... I promise I will help you.
e_faen15_b_rp1_s=(Bree) "What are you talking about? I don't trust you or your kind... All werewolves are scum.<br><br>However... I'm desperate, and your group seems trustworthy. You may be the exception, so I'm willing to take the risk.<br><br>Take these magic shards as thanks, and be sure to plant this seed in a safe place. If you do this for me, I will return to Senenthia and even be willing to give you a chance to explain yourself, werewolf."
e_faen15_b_rp2=Bree? You've really grown since the last time I saw you. Of course I'll help you.
e_faen15_b_rp2_s=(Bree) "Andrin! I'm so glad to see you again. Thank you for playing with me when I was young and comforting me when my mother died...<br><br>As you can see, the situation is dire, and I need your help. As guardian of the forest, and in honor of Ylmer, I need to plant his seeds.<br><br>Take these magic shards as thanks, and help me plant the last seed in a safe place. If you do, I'll be able to return to Senenthia and help you with whatever you need."
e_faen15_b_rp3=I'm glad to see you found the grove. Now I can help you.
e_faen15_b_rp3_s=(Bree) "Ohh, you are the young elf who showed me the way when I came to this forest. Thank you very much.<br><br>I see that now you are free to go wherever you want... I, on the other hand, still have to stay here. The cold threatens my purpose, and I need your help once again.<br><br>Take these magic shards as thanks, and be sure to plant this seed somewhere safe. If you do this for me, I will be able to move freely again. I'll be able to return to my forest in Senenthia and help you with whatever you need."
e_faen15_b_rp4=You tell her that you don't have time to be a gardener.
e_faen15_b_rp4_s=She seems quite angry with you for not wanting to take on this responsibility after defeating Ylmer.<br><br>Still, she turns back to the grove and lets you go.
e_faen16_a_nm=The owl sanctuary
e_faen16_a_dsc=You arrive at a large tree that appears to be an owl sanctuary. As you approach, the elf guarding the place says to you:<br><br>"Ohh! What good timing... I really need your help. The intense cold is agitating the owls... We usually sing them an ancient song to calm them down, but the other elves are busy with the owl guardians.<br><br>I can teach you that ancient song, and even give you some magic shards, if you help me calm them down."
e_faen16_a_dsca=Do you want to learn and sing the ancient song?
e_faen16_a_rp0=You tell him you don't have time to sing, and leave.
e_faen16_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_faen16_a_rp1=You try to sing the ancient song in chorus.
e_faen16_a_rp1_s=The elf teaches you the ancient song, and after a while, everyone starts singing...<br><br>Your interpretation is a success!

e_faen16_a_rp1_sc=The elf teaches you the ancient song, and after a while, everyone starts singing...<br><br>Your interpretation is a resounding success!

e_faen16_a_rp1_f=The elf teaches you the ancient song, and after a while, everyone starts singing...<br><br>Your interpretation is not good enough! The owls are even more agitated than before, and the elf gets a little angry. He asks you to leave before things get complicated.<br><br>At least you've learned the ancient song.
e_faen16_a_rp1_fc=The elf teaches you the ancient song, and after a while, everyone starts singing...<br><br>Your interpretation is really bad! The owls are furious and start clawing at you, causing several wounds. The infuriated angry elf asks you to leave before things get even more complicated.<br><br>At least you've learned the ancient song.
e_faen16_a_rp2=I can try to sing it along with the elf...
e_faen16_a_rp2_s=The elf teaches the ancient song to Andrin, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is a success! The owls fly in a circle above him and give him their blessing. When the song ends, the owls calm down and return to their nests.<br><br>The elf is very grateful and gives you a lot of magic shards.
e_faen16_a_rp2_f=The elf teaches the ancient song to Andrin, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is really bad!

e_faen16_a_rp3_s=The elf teaches the ancient song to Thuls, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is a success!

e_faen16_a_rp3_f=The elf teaches the ancient song to Thuls, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is really bad!

e_faen16_a_rp4=A new song! Yeahh! I want to learn it and sing it!
e_faen16_a_rp4_s=The elf teaches the ancient song to Gustav, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is a success!

e_faen16_a_rp5=I'll sing it myself. I've done it several times before.
e_faen16_a_rp5_s=Sylvie already knows the song, as she often came to the sanctuary to train with her pet. Sylvie and the elf already know each other, and the two sing the song together.<br><br>The owls fly in a circle above her and give her their blessing. When the song ends, the owls calm down and return to their nests.<br><br>The elf thanks Sylvie and gives her a lot of magic shards.
e_faen17_a_nm=The owl guardian
e_faen17_a_dsc=You come to a large owl statue. It seems that the elves use these statues to protect the forest from the growing cold.
e_faen17_a_dsca=The statue seems to be in good condition and working properly. There is not much else you can do here for the moment.
e_faen17_a_rp0=You continue on your way and ignore the statue.
e_faen17_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_faen17_a_rp1=Wait here. Let me check something.
e_faen17_a_rp1_s=Sylvie does a routine check of the statue and then looks around.<br><br>After a while, she returns with a few magic shards and a depleted magic sapphire. The sapphire still seems to be quite expensive.
e_faen17_b_nm=The depleted guardian
e_faen17_b_dsc=You come to a large owl statue that the elves use to protect the forest from the cold, but it seems to be malfunctioning. As you approach, you see a young elf who says to you:<br><br>"What are you doing in this forest? You shouldn't be here... The magic stone that powers this owl guardian is almost depleted. When its energy runs out, the cold will grow, and the dead will advance into the sanctuary.<br><br>As an elf, it is my duty to stay and protect the sanctuary... If only I had another magic stone, or something to replace it!
e_faen17_b_dsca=I'm sorry, but you must leave before it's too late."
e_faen17_b_rp0=You give her the moonstone you stole from the elder dryad.
e_faen17_b_rp0_s=(Elf) "Ohh, this is perfect! Just what I needed. This magic stone is even better than ours; it seems to recharge at night.<br><br>By the way, I'm Sylvie. Thanks to you, I can now leave the forest in peace. I have some personal business to finish first, but after that you can count on me for whatever you want.<br><br>Before you go, accept these magic shards and this sapphire that powered the owl guardian. Although it's almost depleted, I'm sure it still has a lot of value."
e_faen17_b_rp1=You can't help her. You listen to her and leave.
e_faen17_b_rp1_s=The young elf bids you farewell as she leans against the statue to rest.
e_faen17_b_rp2=Elf... The city is frozen, and the forest will fall soon... You should leave, too.
e_faen17_b_rp2_s=(Elf) "I know about the city... I've been there... But even so, I must stay.<br><br>Thanks for the advice, I guess... Take these magic shards. I'm sure they will be of more use to you than to me."<br><br>As you leave, the elf leans against the statue to rest.
e_faen17_b_rp3=I can see how we'll beat the cold...but I can't help you right now.
e_faen17_b_rp3_s=(Elf) "Thank you for trying to give me hope...but without the active owl guardian, it will be too late for the sanctuary.<br><br>Anyway... Take these magic shards. I'm sure they will be of more use to you than to me."<br><br>As you leave, the elf leans against the statue to rest.
e_faen18_a_nm=The Happy Owl
e_faen18_a_dsc=You arrive at the Happy Owl inn and notice that the inn has a very peculiar tricolor flag on the door.<br><br>Inside the inn, the atmosphere is cold despite the lit fireplace. The faces of the few elves sheltering from the cold do not look very happy.<br><br>The innkeeper approaches you, asking what brings you here, and if you need anything.
e_faen18_a_dsca=This might be a good time to rest or get some information.
e_faen18_a_rp0=You tell her you just need to get some rest.
e_faen18_a_rp0_s=As she doesn't have many customers, the innkeeper lets you rest for a while before you continue on your way.
e_faen18_a_rp1=You pay her 400g to serve you something.
e_faen18_a_rp1_s=She brings you some food and drinks, and you rest until you are back to full health.
e_faen18_a_rp2=You pay her 1,600g to have a big feast.
e_faen18_a_rp2_s=She brings you the best food and drinks she has, in large quantities. You also invite the rest of the elves of the inn to cheer them up a bit.<br><br>It was a good feast, and you are fully rested.
e_faen18_a_rp3=You ask her what happened here. Why is everything frozen?
e_faen18_a_rp3_s=(Innkeeper) "It all happened a few days ago, when the dormant obelisk was suddenly activated. Soon after, the Frost Calamity descended from the skies and, with its arrival, instantly froze half the city.<br><br>We were lucky to be outside the walls...but now, to make matters worse, there are rumors that the frozen dead are rising inside the city."<br><br>Thanks to this valuable information, you decide to prepare yourselves thoroughly against the cold (+8% cold resistance).
e_faen18_a_rp4=You ask her if she knows the owner of this old journal.
e_faen18_a_rp4_s=(Innkeeper) "That is my grandfather's diary... If you have it, I guess he passed away in the pursuit of his dream.<br><br>You see, my grandfather founded this inn and gave it the tricolor flag with his three favorite colors: green, yellow and blue. He was a great merchant, and he always used to tell me about a magic circle somewhere in the world with colored runes. According to him, putting the colors on our flag would fulfill the dreams of any merchant.<br><br>Thank you for returning his diary. Please rest as much as you need, and take these magic shards."
e_faen19_a_nm=Closed sewers
e_faen19_a_dsc=You arrive at the outlet of the city sewer, which is closed by a barred gate.<br><br>You take a look inside the sewers, and it seems that everything is frozen. You seem to see something moving...
e_faen19_a_dsca=The gate appears to be firmly closed.
e_faen19_a_rp0=You don't want to enter the sewers.
e_faen19_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_faen19_a_rp1=Let's go inside. I have the key.
e_faen19_a_rp1_s=Zek reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small key with which he unlocks the barred gate.<br><br>You decide to enter the sewers.<br><br>The cold inside the sewers is extreme. You must hurry or you will freeze to death.
e_faen19_b_nm=The exiled
e_faen19_b_dsc=You arrive at the outlet of the city sewer, which is closed by a barred gate. Here you find a ratman who seems to be desperately searching for something. As you approach, you hear him say:<br><br>"Without the key, there's no point in going in!

e_secta1_a_nm=Silly gatekeepers
e_secta1_a_dsc=You are inside the hatch. Here you can see what at first glance seems to be a normal basement, but at the end of the room, you can see a door with three pigmen keeping watch.<br><br>They are new to this place and don't seem very excited about having to stand guard. In fact, one of them is lying down and almost asleep.<br><br>The other two don't seem to be very smart either, but they could raise the alarm depending on how you approach.
e_secta1_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar13_a_dsca
e_secta1_a_rp0=Clearly, this is not a normal basement. You leave now, while you still can.
e_secta1_a_rp0_s=You climb the stairs back to the surface.
e_secta1_a_rp1=Charge at them directly so they can't call reinforcements.
e_secta1_a_rp1_s=They are surprised to see you here, and only have time to grab a torch to defend themselves. The one sleeping barely has time to wake up.
e_secta1_a_rp2=Act as if you were one of them, and go ahead.
e_secta1_a_rp2_s=Since they are new recruits, and you are already in the basement, they did not doubt you for a moment. They open the door for you, and you go inside.
e_secta1_a_rp2_sc=As they are new recruits, and you are already in the basement, they have not doubted for a moment. They open the door and give you a small bag of gold that they say you left behind when you left last time.
e_secta1_a_rp2_f=Your attempt to impersonate one of them has gone wrong, and you are discovered.<br><br>As you see that you are discovered, you have no choice but to fight.
e_secta1_a_rp2_fc=Though they're new recruits, you have overdone your attempt to impersonate being one of them, and they discover you.<br><br>They torch your ass as you try to pass by, and the fight begins.
e_secta1_a_rp3=Make a noise to distract two of them, and use the old rope to tie the one sleeping.
e_secta1_a_rp3_s=You tie the half-asleep pigman and move him aside while the other two are distracted.<br><br>When they turn to the door, it is too late, and you are already on them.
e_secta1_a_rp4=They don't seem very smart. Let me try to intimidate them.
e_secta1_a_rp4_s=Magnus appeared from the shadows before the pigmen, with a grim look and showing his fangs.<br><br>He didn't have to say anything. When they saw him, the pigmen ran hastily past the rest of the group and climbed up the hatch without thinking twice.<br><br>You found a small gold sack where the pigman was sleeping.
e_secta1_a_rp4_f=It's hard for Magnus to pretend to be a wild werewolf, and the pigmen realize this after a brief scare.<br><br>They abruptly attack him with the torches, and the fight begins.
e_secta1_a_rp5=I will show them this staff and order them to let us pass.
e_secta1_a_rp5_s=Fortunately, one of them recognizes the staff. They bow to Cornelius and open the door for you.
e_secta1_a_rp5_f=The pigmen do not recognize the staff or Cornelius. Perhaps the recruits are too new, or maybe it is Cornelius's fault...thinking he is someone else again.<br><br>While Cornelius is confused and lost in his thoughts, they prepare to fight.
e_secta1_a_rp6=I can easily put these simpletons to sleep.
e_secta1_a_rp6_s=Nezglekt casts a spell, and all the pigmen instantly fall asleep on the ground. You take advantage of the fact that they are asleep to steal a small bag of gold and cross the door.
e_secta1_a_rp7=I will convince them to return to the right path and leave this place.
e_secta1_a_rp7_s=Ottis approaches the pigmen and gives them a good lecture. After a while, he seems to convince them, and they leave the basement.<br><br>Ottis returns to the group with a big smile on his face, and on top of that, he has been given a bag of gold as a thank you.
e_secta1_a_rp7_f=Ottis approaches the pigmen and gives them a good lecture, but something goes wrong, and the pigmen get upset about something Ottis has said.<br><br>Suddenly they attack him with the torches, and the fight starts.
e_secta4_a_nm=The bottomless pit
e_secta4_a_dsc=Moving next to the big pit in the middle of the room, you come to a ledge.<br><br>Clearly, those cultists are throwing something in there...but you're not sure what it could be.<br><br>The hole looks really deep, and you can't see the bottom. Plus, there is no apparent way down.
e_secta4_a_dsca=Do you want to try throwing something?
e_secta4_a_rp0=You don't know what to throw, and maybe it's for the best.
e_secta4_a_rp0_s=You ignore the pit and move on.
e_secta4_a_rp1=Go closer and stare at the dark bottom of the pit.
e_secta4_a_rp1_s=With your eyes wide open, you try to see the bottom.<br><br>When you are getting used to the darkness, you suddenly notice that something is staring back at you.
e_secta4_a_rp2=Throw a group member into the pit. Fate will decide who it is.
e_secta4_a_rp2_s=You push the unlucky one into the hole. The drop is long...but after a while, they are magically teleported back to the group. Whatever is at the bottom didn't like what you threw.<br><br>This was an unforgettable and very traumatic experience.
e_secta4_a_rp2_f=You hear screams for a while and feel a little remorse, but just a little.
e_secta4_a_rp3=You remember tying up a pigman at the entrance...
e_secta4_a_rp3_s=You went to get him, and you untied the poor pigman on the ledge, saving the rope for another time. Without any remorse, you push the pigman into the pit.<br><br>After a while, you hear a strange and deep voice in a language you cannot understand. You feel a powerful energy that emanates from the pit and surrounds you.<br><br>You discovered what cultists throw into the pit.
e_secta4_a_rp4=I can feel a powerful dark being at the bottom. I will try to communicate.
e_secta4_a_rp4_s=Zek speaks in the language of the dark gods to try to get an answer...<br><br>The answer doesn't come, but whatever is inside the pit considers Zek worthy. A strange energy comes out of the pit and surrounds him.
e_secta4_a_rp4_f=Zek speaks in the language of the dark gods to try to get an answer...<br><br>The answer doesn't come, but whatever is inside the pit considers Zek unworthy, and a loud grunt comes from the pit.
e_secta4_a_rp5=I will absorb a small part of the dark energy of the pit for myself.
e_secta4_a_rp5_s=Malukah carefully manipulates a part of the dark energy emanating of the pit and makes it her own.
e_secta5_a_nm=The summoning ritual
e_secta5_a_dsc=You reach the end of the basement, and here you can see many cultists in a summoning circle.<br><br>The summoning has begun, and from the number of cultists, it does not seem like just a normal imp will show up.<br><br>They become aware of your presence near the ritual, and some cultists leave the circle to confront you.
e_secta5_a_dsca=The cultist looks at you suspiciously, waiting for an answer.
e_secta5_a_rp0=You respond by drawing your weapons and striking first.
e_secta5_a_rp0_s=They react a little slowly, and you start the fight with some advantage.
e_secta5_a_rp1=Tell them you are new here, and you've come to help with the ritual.
e_secta5_a_rp1_s=You are in their basement and at the ritual, so after a brief moment of doubt, they let you join.
e_secta5_a_rp1_sc=They welcome you with open arms and give you several magic shards to help them finish the ritual.
e_secta5_a_rp1_f=They look at you a second time and clearly see that you don't belong here.<br><br>You didn't fool them, and the fight begins.
e_secta5_a_rp1_fc=They look at you a second time and laugh in your face... It was too obvious that you were not one of them. You prepare to fight.
e_secta5_a_rp2=You fools! You don't know what you're doing. Stop this at once!
e_secta5_a_rp2_s=The nearby cultist recognizes Cornelius immediately. They bow down and leave, but it is too late, and the ritual is about to end.
e_secta5_a_rp2_f=Only one of the cultists recognizes Cornelius. When he sees no reaction from his comrades, he flees from the fight that is about to begin.
e_secta5_a_rp3=I am a specialist in this sort of ritual. Let me help you.
e_secta5_a_rp3_s=They don't need to look at Zek twice to know he's telling the truth. Since you are already there, they see no problem in letting you help with the ritual.
e_secta5_b_nm=Lord of the imps
e_secta5_b_dsc=The ritual ended, the room filled with red smoke, and the temperature rose rapidly. You don't know if it went well or not, but all the remaining cultists start to flee in panic after realizing what they've done.<br><br>An impressive imp appears before you. It's the greater demon Belphyor, the Lord of the Imps.<br><br>(Belphyor) "What do you want from me, mortal?"
e_secta5_b_dsca=Although he's been weakened by the precarious summoning conditions, you can't underestimate him.
e_secta5_b_rp0=Well... We were just passing through, killing cultists... Can we leave?
e_secta5_b_rp0_s=(Belphyor) "Ha ha ha... That's a good one... I can clearly see that you are not one of those pesky cultists, and that you can use your brain.<br><br>Well, I'll allow you to leave."<br><br>You leave the basement before he changes his mind.
e_secta5_b_rp0_sc=(Belphyor) "Ha ha ha... That's a good one... I can clearly see that you are not one of those pesky cultists, and that you can use your brain.<br><br>Well, I'll allow you to leave."<br><br>You leave the basement before he changes his mind. On your way out, you pick up a few magic shards from the bodies of the dead cultists.
e_secta5_b_rp0_f=(Belphyor) "Ha ha ha... That's a good one... I can clearly see that you are not one of those pesky cultists, and that you can use your brain.<br><br>But I am afraid you killed lots of imps in the process, so I cannot allow you to leave."<br><br>The fight begins.
e_secta5_b_rp0_fc=(Belphyor) "Ha ha ha... That's a good one... I can clearly see that you are not one of those pesky cultists, and that you can use your brain.<br><br>But don't take me for a fool."<br><br>Belphyor throws a fire spell at you before you can react, and you suffer burns. You defend yourself the best you can.
e_secta5_b_rp1=He is weakened. Now is a good chance to defeat him forever. Attack him.
e_secta5_b_rp1_s=(Belphyor) "Fool..."<br><br>The fight begins.
e_secta5_b_rp2=Oh, great Belphyor... Maybe there is something we can do for you?
e_secta5_b_rp2_s=(Belphyor) "Interesting... You don't seem to be one of those cultists who enslave my kind by summoning us whenever they like.<br><br>Here's the deal: take this scroll and use it in a place full of cultists. It will summon a horde of imps, and they will take revenge without being controlled.<br><br>Do this and you will be greatly rewarded."<br><br>You get the scroll and leave the basement.
e_secta5_b_rp2_sc=(Belphyor) "Interesting... You don't seem to be one of those cultists who enslaves my kind by summoning us whenever they like.<br><br>Here's the deal: take this scroll and use it in a place full of cultists. It will summon a horde of imps, and they will take revenge without being controlled.<br><br>Do this and you will be greatly rewarded."<br><br>You get the scroll, and on your way out, you collect some magic shards from the dead cultists.
e_secta5_b_rp2_f=(Belphyor) "Interesting... You don't seem to be one of those cultists who enslaves my kind by summoning us whenever they like.<br><br>But there is no way I'll let you live after all the imps you have slaughtered."<br><br>The fight begins.
e_secta5_b_rp2_fc=(Belphyor) "Interesting... You don't seem to be one of those cultists who enslaves my kind by summoning us whenever they like.<br><br>But don't take me for a fool."<br><br>Belphyor throws a fire spell at you before you can react, and you suffer burns. You defend yourself the best you can.
e_secta5_b_rp3=Hello...old friend... We meet again.
e_secta5_b_rp3_s=(Belphyor) "I see you're still alive... And you dare to call me old friend? Last time, you summoned me into the depths of that damned forge and then abandoned me to my fate. You owe me one, and now is the perfect time to repay me.<br><br>Your former followers are using my imps as mere tools... They've had enough, and now they're out for revenge. Take this scroll and use it in a place full of cultists.<br><br>Do this for me, and we'll be even. Plus, I'll reward you generously."
e_secta5_c_nm=A great feat
e_secta5_c_dsc=You have defeated a greater demon!<br><br>Although he has not died, he's returned to his plane of existence and will take time to recover. Still, it is a great achievement that must be celebrated.<br><br>There should be some magic shards in the demon's remains, and now that the basement is empty of cultists, you can loot it.
e_secta5_c_dsca=rptd_e_aquar28_c_dsca
e_secta5_c_rp0=Loot the basement and get some rest.
e_secta5_c_rp0_s=You collect all the magic shards and also find a hidden chest near the summoning circle.<br><br>One of the greater demon's horns remained after the fight. You take it as a trophy and proof of your deed.<br><br>You open the chest and rest for a while.
e_secta6_a_nm=The imp altar
e_secta6_a_dsc=At the end of the hall you find a large stone statue of an imp.<br><br>Although the placement of this statue is suspicious, it's clear that it is used as an altar of some kind.<br><br>You've found imps before wandering around freely, and this statue may have something to do with it.
e_secta6_a_dsca=What do you want to do?
e_secta6_a_rp0=You do not want to touch this altar and be surrounded by imps by accident.
e_secta6_a_rp0_s=You ignore the altar and move on.
e_secta6_a_rp1=Carefully, you inspect the statue to find something unusual.
e_secta6_a_rp1_s=You notice some small loose stones on the statue. Upon closer examination, you discover that those stones are buttons.<br><br>You press the one that looks more used, and a secret door opens behind the statue.
e_secta6_a_rp1_sc=You notice some small loose stones on the statue. Upon closer inspection, you discover that these stones are buttons.<br><br>You press the one that seems to be the most used, and a secret door opens behind the statue, as well as a small compartment on the statue containing magic shards.
e_secta6_a_rp1_f=You notice some small loose stones on the statue. Upon closer examination, you discover that those stones are buttons, but it is too late because you've already pressed some of them in the process.<br><br>A secret door opened behind the statue, but it also activated the altar, which begins to summon imps.
e_secta6_a_rp1_fc=You notice some small loose stones on the statue. Upon closer inspection, you discover that those stones are buttons, but it's too late because you've already pressed some of them in the process.<br><br>A secret door opened behind the statue, but it also activated the altar, which starts summoning imps that quickly surround you. The imps attack you with fire, causing you burns, and now you have to defend yourself.
e_secta6_a_rp2=Smash the statue so that it can no longer be used.
e_secta6_a_rp2_s=You gather all your strength and break the statue with a single blow.<br><br>In the remains of the statue you discover lots of magic shards.
e_secta6_a_rp2_sc=You gather all your strength and break the statue with a single blow.<br><br>When you break the statue, a secret door is activated behind it. In the remains of the statue you discover a bunch of magic shards.
e_secta6_a_rp2_f=Your attacks leave some marks on the statue, but they are not strong enough to break it with one blow.<br><br>The blows activate the statue, which begins to summon imps.
e_secta6_a_rp2_fc=Your attacks leave some marks on the statue, but they are not strong enough to break it with one blow.<br><br>The blows activate the statue, which begins to summon imps. They attack you with fire, causing you burns, and now you have to defend yourself.
e_secta6_a_rp3=I know how to best use these imp altars.
e_secta6_a_rp3_s=Cornelius chants something nearly inaudible and casts a fire spell on the altar.<br><br>Surprisingly, the altar shines, and a secret door opens behind it.<br><br>Also, you can now use this altar to upgrade one card for free.
e_secta6_a_rp4=Ask the pigman you tied up at the entrance how this works.
e_secta6_a_rp4_s=You promise the pigman that you will free him if he tells you how this altar works.<br><br>He goes behind the statue and presses a button. A secret door suddenly opens.<br><br>As promised, you untie the pigman and keep the old rope. The pigman runs off towards the exit.
e_secta6_a_rp5=Let me examine this statue in detail.
e_secta6_a_rp5_s=Wilbur approaches the statue and examines it carefully. After a while, you hear a "click" and a secret door opens behind the statue.
e_secta7_a_nm=An ephemeral potion
e_secta7_a_dsc=The secret door takes you to a room with a large chest.<br><br>You open the chest and find some items that might be useful. Among them, a bright orange potion catches your eye.<br><br>As soon as you take the potion out of the chest, its contents begin to disappear. You don't know if it is drinkable, but there is no time, and only one can drink it before it completely vanishes.
e_secta7_a_dsca=Who will drink it?
e_secta7_a_rp0=None of you feel like drinking an unidentified potion found in a basement.
e_secta7_a_rp0_s=You ignore the potion and collect the other items in the chest.
e_secta7_a_rp1=Let fate decide who will drink it.
e_secta7_a_rp1_s=When you drink the potion, you notice your body warming up.<br><br>After a brief moment, you feel a surge of energy within you, and your body temperature drops again. You do not know exactly why, but you believe that this phenomenon will repeat itself again.
e_secta7_a_rp1_f=You take the rest of the items in the chest.
e_secta7_a_rp2=I will drink it.
e_secta7_a_rp2_s=When you drink the potion, you notice your body warming up.<br><br>After a brief moment, you feel a surge of energy within you, and your body temperature drops again. You do not know exactly why, but you believe that this phenomenon will repeat itself again.<br><br>You take the rest of the items in the chest.
e_secta8_a_nm=Leaving the basement
e_secta8_a_dsc=After resting for a while and thoroughly inspecting the basement, there is nothing left to do here.
e_secta8_a_dsca=Now you can get out of the basement.
e_secta8_a_rp0=You leave the basement.
e_secta8_a_rp0_s=You walk through the basement full of dead cultists and exit.
e_demoend_nm=End of Demo
e_demoend_dsc=Thank you for playing Across the Obelisk Demo.<br><br>The final game will have 4 acts, more heroes to unlock, more events, more items, different kinds of nodes and much more!!<br><br>You will now get a reward, and you can try the demo again, craft something in the town and try a different path!
e_demoend_dsca=If you have any suggestions or want to leave your feedback, you can do so at our Discord.
e_demoend_rp0=Finish the demo.
e_demoend_rp0_s=continue
e_sen12_a_nm=The hatch
e_sen12_a_dsc=You come across a house in ruins, and inside you see a large hatch.<br><br>You try to open the hatch, but it is properly closed. A few seconds later, a voice speaks to you through the hatch:<br><br>"Only those touched by the flames..."<br><br>Then the voice remains silent, as if waiting for a passphrase.
e_sen12_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar13_a_dsca
e_sen12_a_rp0=You don't know the passphrase, so you leave.
e_sen12_a_rp0_s=You walk away from the hatch.
e_sen12_a_rp1=Jumping on the hatch will break it. The problem will be trying to land on your feet.
e_sen12_a_rp1_s=A perfect landing, and nothing seems to be broken.
e_sen12_a_rp1_f=Ouch... The impact of the fall was too strong for you, and something broke.
e_sen12_a_rp2=Try to open the hatch in a safer way than jumping on it.
e_sen12_a_rp2_s=You find a small opening in the hatch, and using your weapons as a crowbar, you manage to open it.
e_sen12_a_rp2_sc=You search around the ruined house and find a hidden note with the passphrase, and a bag with a few magic shards.<br><br>You go back to the hatch, and when you say the passphrase, they open it for you.
e_sen12_a_rp2_f=You have taken too long to find the way to open the hatch. You hear how the people inside reinforce the hatch after not hearing the answer passphrase.<br><br>You don't want to waste any more time here and leave.
e_sen12_a_rp2_fc=It takes you too long to find a way to open the hatch, and a pigman patrol has returned. They see you desperately trying to open it, and laugh at you as they prepare to attack.<br><br>You hear the hatch close further. There's nothing you can do about it.
e_sen12_a_rp3=Hmm... That sounds very familiar. Let me remember...
e_sen12_a_rp3_s=Cornelius thinks for a while and says:<br><br>"Only those touched by the flames...can see beyond the burning hand."<br><br>Then he mutters under his breath to you that he thinks he remembers that he was the one who invented this nonsense... The hatch opens.
e_sen12_a_rp3_f=rptd_e_aquar39_a_rp0_f
e_sen12_a_rp4=I can try to read their minds and find out.
e_sen12_a_rp4_s=Nezglekt concentrates on those behind the hatch to try to figure out the passphrase. After a while, he doesn't even need to say it, as he manages to control one of them to open the hatch directly.
e_sen12_a_rp4_f=Nezglekt concentrates on those behind the hatch to try to figure out the passphrase. After a while, he discovers nothing, as he can't see them and can't concentrate on a specific individual.<br><br>There is nothing more you can do. You have already wasted too much time here, so you leave.
e_sen13_a_nm=The new recruits
e_sen13_a_dsc=You have reached a crossroads: to the north the path leads to an old watchtower, to the south the path leads you to the bridges that cross the river.<br><br>The northern path appears to be blocked by a pigman with a brand on his arm who is trying to recruit others for what appears to be a cult.<br><br>If you want to go north, you will have to deal with them.
e_sen13_a_dsca=How would you like to proceed?
e_sen13_a_rp0=Forget about the north path and go south.
e_sen13_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_faen3_a_rp0_s
e_sen13_a_rp1=You attack them to clear the way.
e_sen13_a_rp1_s=You approach them quickly and catch them off guard. The marked pigman summons a fire imp, and the fight begins.
e_sen13_a_rp2=Tell them to disappear from your sight and clear the way.
e_sen13_a_rp2_s=The poor recruits run away, and the other pigman, who sees how he has been left alone, also leaves.<br><br>They left in a hurry and forgot to take a bag of gold and some shards.
e_sen13_a_rp2_sc=The threat scared them so much that, before they leave, they ask for your forgiveness and give you everything they have, to make sure you don't come after them.<br><br>Among their things is some gold, a few shards and some items that might be useful to you.
e_sen13_a_rp2_f=You have frightened only one of the recruits who runs away... The other recruit stays and prepares to fight.<br><br>Meanwhile, the marked pigman summons a fire imp and attacks you.
e_sen13_a_rp2_fc=They ignore your threats and instantly throw a couple of torches at you, causing your clothes to start burning and giving you small burns.<br><br>You have no choice but to defend yourself as best you can.
e_sen13_a_rp3=I will scare them by pretending to be a savage werewolf.
e_sen13_a_rp3_s=Magnus howled fiercely and charged at them with a wild look.<br><br>The poor pigmen didn't think twice and ran without looking back.<br><br>They left behind all their belongings. Maybe you can find something useful.
e_sen13_a_rp3_f=Magnus howled fiercely and the pigmen shuddered, but then pulled themselves together at the sight of Magnus's refined mustache and clean fur.<br><br>They throw a torch at Magnus's face, and the branded pigman summons a fire imp while preparing to fight.
e_sen13_a_rp4=Oink... These poor fellow pigmen have lost their way in life. Let me enlighten them.
e_sen13_a_rp4_s=Ottis approaches the pigmen and begins a long conversation.<br><br>When he's done speaking, both the branded pigman and the recruits thank him and leave.<br><br>They left all their belongings behind. Maybe you can find something you can use.
e_sen13_a_rp4_f=Ottis approaches the pigmen and begins a long conversation.<br><br>Something didn't go well, and in the middle of the talks, one of the recruits leaves, but the other throws a torch at Ottis's face.<br><br>The branded pigman summons a fire imp and attacks you.
e_sen13_a_rp5=I think I recognize that brand... I will order them to stay away.
e_sen13_a_rp5_s=With a dignified pose, Cornelius approaches the pigmen.<br><br>When they see him, the pigmen bow down... Perhaps they have mistaken him for one of their own...

e_sen15_a_rp0_s=When you leave, you hear the sound of something crawling in that cavity.

e_sen17_b_dsc=When you cross the bridges, an old man who rests to one side looks at you and says:<br><br>"Hello, young ones...

I remember I had a spare one that I used in my younger days... It was a very special staff imbued with fire magic, but I left it far from here.<br><br>If you get the staff back for me...

e_sen17_b_rp0=You offer him your help and ask him where you can find his old staff.
e_sen17_b_rp0_s=(Old man) "Let me remember... I used to be in a special group of people... Maybe one of them has my staff, or they keep it for me in case I come back.

I don't quite remember why, but one day I went away and left my staff with them. I'm sure my old staff is still at their main base.<br><br>Thank you for helping this old man. Take these magic shards as thanks."
e_sen17_b_rp2=Cornelius? It's me, Wilbur. Don't you remember an old friend?
e_sen17_b_rp2_s=(Cornelius) "Wilbur...mmm... Ha! Now I remember! It's been too long since the dwarf revolt at the Black Forge.<br><br>As you see, I am already very old, and unlike you... I need a good staff to get around. I left my old staff at the main base of the Burning Hand, in the Velkarath mountains. Could you go get it for me, please?<br><br>Thanks for helping me, old friend. Take these magic shards as thanks."
e_sen17_b_rp3=Tell him you don't have time to listen to his stories.

e_sen18_a_rp3=Hello, brother, show me how much you have improved.

e_sen18_b_rp2=I will howl fiercely to scare those pigmen.

Oink... That the werewolves didn't find... Take what you need.<br><br>Thank you... Oink... And make sure you take the road that leads north through the Forest Border."
e_sen21_b_rp1=Ottis, calm down, what are you doing here? Are you sure it was Yogger who did this?
e_sen21_b_rp1_s=(Ottis) "Magnus! Thank God it's you. You gave me quite a scare... Oink. I came back when I found out my pigmen brothers were being recruited by a strange cult. So I settled in this chapel... Oink...and I do sermons to dissuade them from joining the cult.<br><br>Yogger found out and sent his werewolves after me. He's still obsessed with eating me. Oink. Please help me, Magnus. Yogger leads his werewolves from the bandit camp in the north of the forest.<br><br>I have some things here that they didn't find... Oink, take what you need."
e_sen21_b_rp2=You tell the supposed priest that you don't have time for his delusions.
e_sen21_b_rp2_s=As you leave the chapel you hear the priest crying in a corner.<br><br>(Priest) "Noooo... Oink... Oink...<br><br>Oink... I'm dead meat."
e_sen22_a_nm=The fang gates
e_sen22_a_dsc=You are entering the northern part of the forest. The fang gates guarding the bandit camp stand before you and the path ahead will not be easy.<br><br>Now is the perfect time to rest or prepare for the battle ahead.<br><br>Remember that you don't have much time to spare, so you can only do one activity before continuing.
e_sen22_a_dsca=What will it be?
e_sen22_a_rp0=Relax and recover some strength.
e_sen22_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar14_a_rp0_s

e_sen22_a_rp1_sc=Below a suspicious trunk you found a hidden cache of the bandits and a small chest.
e_sen22_a_rp1_f=Time's up. You don't have more time to wander in the forest, but at least you have recovered some magic shards from it.
e_sen22_a_rp1_fc=While searching for shards, you got too close to the camp and a patrol found you.
e_sen22_a_rp2=I found a forest trail here. Maybe it can lead us directly into the bandit camp.
e_sen22_a_rp2_s=Andrin's tracking skills where on point.<br><br>The trail leads to the bandit camp and now you can take it.<br><br>Also you found some shards and had time to rest a bit.

e_sen24_a_nm=The apprentice craftsman
e_sen24_a_dsc=Hiding behind a tree, you find a gnome fiddling with a couple of gadgets. You approach him and ask him what he is doing there.<br><br>"Hi, I'm Timothy. I'm waiting for my master...but it's been several days since he left me here...and I'm beginning to think he has abandoned me.<br><br>I know I'm not a good apprentice and my inventions tend to backfire...but I'd like him to come back. Please, if you see him, tell him I'm going back to the workshop.<br><br>By the way, if you want, you can keep any of my inventions."
e_sen24_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar28_c_dsca
e_sen24_a_rp0=If you see his master, you will give him the message.
e_sen24_a_rp0_s=After hearing you, the gnome gathers his things and leaves, leaving behind many of his gadgets.<br><br>You search through them to see if there is anything you can use.
e_sen24_a_rp1=You don't have time for this nonsense.
e_sen24_a_rp1_s=You ignore the gnome and continue on your way.
e_sen25_a_nm=Story time!
e_sen25_a_dsc=In the forest, you found a large open space that seems like the perfect place to rest a bit before continuing your journey.<br><br>As you go to set up camp, you notice a group of werewolves camping. They see you and offer to share the camp, one of them also says to you:<br><br>"Hey, do you want to share some stories from your travels with us while we rest?"
e_sen25_a_dsca=Do you want to share their camp and tell them a story?
e_sen25_a_rp0=You don't want to waste time with strangers in the middle of the forest.
e_sen25_a_rp0_s=When you say no, you hear them growl a little, but they stay in their camp and you leave.
e_sen25_a_rp1=Vaguely tell them you want to reach the obelisk.
e_sen25_a_rp1_s=You tell them without much detail that you want to get to the obelisk. After that you go to rest and when you wake up, they have already left.<br><br>You feel refreshed.
e_sen25_a_rp1_sc=Although you tell them your story without much detail, they like it and they tell you that they discovered that the dryads have a large stash in the -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the objects of the dead adventurers who get lost in the forest.<br><br>After exchanging stories, you rest for a while.
e_sen25_a_rp1_f=You tell them your story and go to sleep peacefully. Luckily, you were alert and you discover them taking their weapons and preparing to attack you in the middle of the night.<br><br>You try to defend yourselves.
e_sen25_a_rp1_fc=You tell them the story and go to sleep peacefully. In the middle of your rest you notice a stabbing pain in your side...and the blood begins to flow.<br><br>It doesn't take you long to realize that they are attacking you.<br><br>You try to defend yourselves.
e_sen25_a_rp2=Oink... I know them... They razed my chapel!
e_sen25_a_rp2_s=Ottis hides behind the group so as not to attract attention, the group leaves and camps elsewhere.<br><br>You rest for a bit.
e_sen25_a_rp3=I'll tell them a story about the Wolf Wars. I hope they don't recognize me
e_sen25_a_rp3_s=Magnus tests the waters and tells them a story, without mentioning which side of the Wolf Wars he fought. Luckily, none of them recognized him.<br><br>They befriend Magnus, share their food with him and tell him that they discovered that the dryads have a big stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the objects of the dead adventurers that are lost in the forest.<br><br>After exchanging stories, you rest for a while.
e_sen25_a_rp3_f=Magnus tests the waters and begins to tell a story.<br><br>Unfortunately he tells them that he fought on the side of the kingdom... That's when the werewolves recognize Magnus and pounce on him.<br><br>Quickly, you join Magnus and the fight continues.
e_sen25_a_rp4=Hello fellow metalheads, this song is just for you!
e_sen25_a_rp4_s=Gustav starts playing a song...and surprisingly they like it.<br><br>They befriend Gustav, and even give him some gold. At the end of the song, they tell him that they discovered that the dryads have a big stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the objects of the dead adventurers that are lost in the forest.<br><br>After exchanging songs and stories, you rest for a while.
e_sen25_a_rp4_f=Gustav starts to play a song...and although they don't dislike what they hear...they slowly start to drool thinking about how Gustav will taste.<br><br>Before the song is over, they pounce on him and bite him.<br><br>Quickly, you join Gustav to protect him and the fight continues.
e_sen25_a_rp5=Ohhh marvelous... Willing ears for my stories, let me take a seat.
e_sen25_a_rp5_s=Without missing a moment, Cornelius begins:<br><br>"Was there a time...in a land filled with lava...or was it snow? An evil monster terrified the villagers of a small town..."<br><br>The story continues for so long that everyone in the camp falls asleep.<br><br>You wake up refreshed.
e_sen25_a_rp6=You smell like filthy bandits, and on top of that you are werewolves. You deserve to die!
e_sen25_a_rp6_s=Without a second thought, Bree lunges at one of them and smashes his head with her club. The other werewolves flee in terror.<br><br>After finding a small bag of gold on the dead werewolf, you push him aside and rest for a bit in the camp.
e_sen25_a_rp7=Tell them how you defeated the greater demon, Belphyor.
e_sen25_a_rp7_s=You speak of your battle with the greater demon, Belphyor, showing his horn as evidence.<br><br>They are really impressed with you and tell you their own story, they discovered that the dryads have a large stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the items of the dead adventurers who get lost in the forest.<br><br>You rest for a while before continuing.
e_sen25_a_rp8=Show them just the note with the tree and ask about it.
e_sen25_a_rp8_s=You tell them a fake story about why you are looking for that tree.<br><br>They believe you and tell you that the tree is near the southeast fang gate.<br><br>After that you rest for a bit.
e_sen25_a_rp9=Tell them how you helped someone named Raúl.
e_sen25_a_rp9_s=They tell you that Raúl is good friends with them and that his brother has a stall near here.<br><br>They also tell you that they discovered that the dryads have a large stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the items of the dead adventurers who get lost in the forest.<br><br>You rest for a while before continuing.

e_sen25_a_rp10_s=They suddenly jump when they hear your story.<br><br>(Werewolf) "Ohhh... So the little piggy is still alive and in the chapel.<br><br>Great, we won't have to go back to Yogger empty-handed."<br><br>They laugh and attack you.
e_sen27_a_nm=Fresh meat!
e_sen27_a_dsc=As the priest told you, Yogger is here. You can clearly see a big werewolf in the middle of the camp, yelling and giving orders to other werewolves.<br><br>He immediately notices your presence and looks at you with a mocking face.<br><br>Time to honor your promise to the priest and kill him. The butcher of Senenthia has terrorized this forest for far too long.
e_sen27_a_dsca=Running away now would only make things worse.
e_sen27_a_rp0=There isn't much more to say. He dies today.
e_sen27_a_rp0_s=You attack.
e_sen27_a_rp1=You didn't expect him to be that big... Maybe there's a slim chance of escape.
e_sen27_a_rp1_s=You run like never before, after a while you leave the bandit camp behind.<br><br>You hear Yogger stopping the chase and yelling at his men asking them for your head.
e_sen27_a_rp1_f=It was really foolish of you to think you can outrun a pack of werewolves.<br><br>You can do nothing but defend yourselves as best you can.
e_sen27_a_rp1_fc=It was really foolish of you to think you can outrun a pack of werewolves.<br><br>Yogger got a jump on you and strikes first, blood starts to flow.
e_sen27_a_rp2=I know him... He served under me in the Wolf Wars. Maybe I can reason with him.
e_sen27_a_rp2_s=(Yogger) "Well, well, well... If it isn't Captain Magnus in flesh. Do you think your fancy words would change me?<br><br>I see you're still as foolish as ever... You don't seem to remember who gave you that scar. This time I will kill you and take the Wolfslayer with me."<br><br>Fortunately, you had time to prepare for combat while he spoke.
e_sen27_a_rp3=You bastard, I'll cleanse this forest of you and your werewolf gang!
e_sen27_a_rp3_s=(Yogger) "Brave words, for someone so young...<br><br>Now that I think about it... About ten years ago I killed someone like you who said the same words to me. I guess history repeats itself.<br><br>This forest is mine now and always will be!"<br><br>Yogger charges at you. Luckily, Bree was careful and placed the group in an advantageous position for the fight.
e_sen27_a_rp4=Argh! Do you think you can make fun of me? Stupid dog!
e_sen27_a_rp4_s=(Yogger) "And who the hell are you..."<br><br>As Yogger speaks, Grukli lunges at him and delivers a deep cut, leaving him stunned and bleeding.<br><br>The rest of the group joins the fight.
e_sen27_a_rp4_f=(Yogger) "And who the hell are you..."<br><br>As Yogger speaks, Grukli lunges at him, but Yogger dodges and counterattacks, wounding him.<br><br>The rest of the group rushes to fight to cover Grukli.
e_sen27_b_nm=rptd_e_sen27_a_nm
e_sen27_b_dsc=When entering the bandit camp, you see a really big werewolf, yelling and giving orders to other werewolves. He notices your presence and looks at you with a mocking face.<br><br>That's Yogger, the butcher of Senenthia, and he has been terrorizing the Senenthia forest for a long time.<br><br>It's time to put a stop to Yogger and disperse the bandits once and for all.
e_sen27_b_dsca=rptd_e_sen27_a_dsca

e_sen27_b_rp5=He really wants to eat me... Oink. Use me as bait...and knock him out first!
e_sen27_b_rp5_s=(Yogger) "You finally accept your fate and come to me, Ottis.<br><br>On top of that, you've put on weight in the last few years... Lucky me."<br><br>The bait is successful, and you hit Yogger in the back of the head while he is distracted by Ottis. The blow isn't hard enough to knock him out, but he looks dazed and weak.
e_sen27_b_rp5_f=(Yogger) "You finally accept your fate and come to me, Ottis.<br><br>On top of that, you've put on weight in the last few years... Lucky me. But don't think I'm so stupid, I know you're up to something so I'm not going to wait... Bon appetit."<br><br>The bait hasn't worked, and Yogger bites Ottis without a second thought. You rush to Ottis's aid, and the fight begins.
e_sen27_c_nm=The butcher's death
e_sen27_c_dsc=You did it! Yogger is no more.<br><br>With the butcher dead, the remaining bandits flee, and the Senenthia Forest will be a little safer.<br><br>Now you can check the camp for gold and other valuable items.
e_sen27_c_dsca=rptd_e_aquar6_a1_dsca
e_sen27_c_rp0=Let's see what you find in the camp.
e_sen27_c_rp0_s=Gold and shards were scattered throughout the camp, and you also found a large chest where the bandits kept all the things they looted over time.
e_sen27_c_rp1=The priest will be happy, but first let's see what you find in the camp.
e_sen27_c_rp1_s=Gold and shards were scattered throughout the camp, and you also found a large chest where the bandits kept all the things they looted over time.<br><br>You honored the promise you gave the priest, and now he can leave his chapel and travel the world again.
e_sen30_a_nm=The boy's trail
e_sen30_a_dsc=You arrive at the forest arch that the baker told you about and begin to examine the area.<br><br>You notice a small empty stall near the arch and wonder who in their right mind would make a store here.<br><br>Next to it, you see a group of four trunkies surrounding a hole in the ground that is covered in bushes. You cannot see what is inside it, but you see a trail of something that has entered or left the hole.
e_sen30_a_dsca=Defeat the trunkies to see what's in the hole.
e_sen30_a_rp0=You didn't expect to fight four trunkies at once. Ignore what you said to the baker and go away.
e_sen30_a_rp0_s=You leave, while you imagine that the boy was already dead anyway.
e_sen30_a_rp1=Try to obtain an advantageous position before starting the fight.
e_sen30_a_rp1_s=It was easy to position yourselves in the best possible way to face this fight. You take the initiative and attack them.
e_sen30_a_rp1_sc=It was easy to position yourselves in the best possible way to face this fight. You have even found a way to hide and ambush.
e_sen30_a_rp1_f=When you were positioning, one of you step on a branch that creaks, the trunkies realize that something is happening and stay on guard. The fight begins but you lost the initiative.
e_sen30_a_rp1_fc=As you were positioning yourselves, one of you stumbles over a branch and falls to the ground, leaving the others exposed and quite embarrassed.<br><br>The trunkies notice and take the opportunity to attack you.
e_sen30_a_rp2=Trunkies are basically living trees... With a fire spell, I am sure to disperse them.
e_sen30_a_rp2_s=Evelyn cast a fire spell, and the trunkies caught fire, but so do the bushes covering the hole.<br><br>If the boy is really in the hole, you don't have any time to waste and must fight the trunkies right now.
e_sen30_a_rp2_f=Evelyn casts a spell, but...that wasn't a "fire spell"... What's more, she didn't even manage to reach the trunkies with that spell, how disappointing of her.<br><br>The trunkies get furious after seeing that she tried to burn them and attack you.
e_sen30_a_rp3=I can only see those trunkies as firewood... Let me burn them all!
e_sen30_a_rp3_s=As a fire spellcaster, Cornelius had no trouble reducing the trunkies to ashes with a powerful spell...<br><br>The problem is that he also incinerated the bushes and surely whatever was in the hole.
e_sen30_a_rp3_f=The spell that Cornelius cast wasn't very powerful, for better or worse only the trunkies caught fire. They charge at you, and the fight begins.
e_sen30_a_rp4=Let me take care of this.
e_sen30_a_rp4_s=Bree approaches the Trunkies and in a solemn voice says:<br><br>"I am Bree, protector of this forest, and I command you to stand aside."<br><br>The trunkies obey and scatter, leaving the way to the hole clear.
e_sen30_b_nm=The werewolf stall
e_sen30_b_dsc=You come to a large stone arch in the middle of the forest, and at one side of the arch you see a stall run by a werewolf. When you approach, he says:<br><br>"Hey, hey, finally some customers! Come close and look at my wares. Half of these items come from the bandits. I'm sure there is something interesting you might need.<br><br>Oh...by the way... I didn't kill that boy over there... He was already dead this morning when I came to set up the stall."
e_sen30_b_dsca=This may be a good time to do some shopping.
e_sen30_b_rp0=rptd_e_aquar26_a_rp0
e_sen30_b_rp0_s=Let's see what he has.
e_sen30_b_rp1=Try to get a discount by pointing out the dead boy next to his stall.
e_sen30_b_rp1_s=(Werewolf) "As I said before, I had nothing to do with it...<br><br>Well, I suppose under these circumstances I can offer you a small discount to show my good faith."<br><br>You got a 15% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp1_sc=(Werewolf) "I already explained that I was not the one who killed him, but as it is your first purchase in my store and given the circumstances I offer you my best products, with a good discount."<br><br>You get a 25% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp1_f=The werewolf growls and says:<br><br>(Werewolf) "I won't repeat myself. The boy was dead before I arrived.<br><br>You can look at my wares, but don't expect any discount."
e_sen30_b_rp1_fc=The werewolf growls and says:<br><br>(Werewolf) "How dare you make me say it again... I didn't kill him!<br><br>Now go away before I get angry."<br><br>The werewolf seems to have no intention of selling you anything, so you leave rather disappointed.
e_sen30_b_rp2=Accuse him of killing the boy. You want a big discount or things will get ugly for him.
e_sen30_b_rp2_s=(Werewolf) "Listen... I'm not afraid of you...and, as you can see, the boy doesn't have any bite marks. I understand that seeing a werewolf alone in the middle of the forest with a corpse of a boy is not very normal...<br><br>I'll give you a good discount, but don't push your luck."<br><br>You got a 30% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp2_sc=(Werewolf) "Listen... I'm not in the mood for a fight and you look pretty strong...<br><br>Given the circumstances I'll give you a good discount and show you my best wares."<br><br>You got a 35% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp2_f=The werewolf growls furiously and says:<br><br>"I've had enough, and I'm not going to say it again, so leave me alone and go away before I get angry."<br><br>You leave before a fight breaks out.
e_sen30_b_rp2_fc=The werewolf growls furiously and says:<br><br>"I've had enough and it looks like you won't leave me alone... I guess your corpses will be my fault, not like that poor kid."<br><br>The werewolf attacks you.
e_sen30_b_rp3=Let me have a conversation wolf to wolf with him.
e_sen30_b_rp3_s=Magnus approaches the werewolf and talks to him. He empathizes with his situation while taking a quick look at the dead boy.<br><br>After a while the conversation ends and both of them shake hands.<br><br>You got a 25% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp3_f=Magnus approaches the werewolf and starts talking to him. Shortly after you hear a low growl and the conversation stops.<br><br>Magnus was unable to get a discount, but at least you can still browse the goods.
e_sen30_b_rp4=Tell him you met his brother Raúl at the riverside camp.
e_sen30_b_rp4_s=(Werewolf) "Ohh... So it was you who helped my little brother!<br><br>Thank you very much, I will offer you my best products and the biggest discount I can do, my friend."<br><br>You got a 40% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp5=Interesting... Seems like a good candidate for my crew.
e_sen30_b_rp5_s=Nezglekt casts a spell on the werewolf and whispers:<br><br>"You can take anything you want from my store."<br><br>The werewolf, who is hypnotized, repeats the phrase. You take advantage of it and take everything you need from the store. Before you leave, Nezglekt takes out a small tadpole and inserts it into the werewolf's eye.
e_sen30_b_rp5_f=Nezglekt casts a spell on the werewolf and whispers:<br><br>"You can take anything you want from my store."<br><br>The werewolf starts to repeat the phrase, but realizes what he is saying and stands there thinking. Before he has time to react you leave the place.
e_sen30_b_rp6=You again? I already told you, I don't want werewolves in my forest!
e_sen30_b_rp6_s=When the werewolf sees Bree, he quickly packs his things and runs off.<br><br>Luckily for you, in his haste he has left a lot of things from the store that could be useful to you.
e_sen30_b_rp7=Hey dude, let me sing you something.
e_sen30_b_rp7_s=(Gustav) "Yeah! in the middle of the forest, come on! We found a very nice werewolf... Croaaakkkk!"<br><br>The werewolf begs you to shut him up and offers you a discount in return.<br><br>You got a 20% discount.
e_sen30_c_nm=The boy in the hole
e_sen30_c_dsc=After dealing with the group of trunkies, you can now freely check out what's inside the hole.
e_sen30_c_dsca=Indeed, the boy is there but...
e_sen30_c_rp0=He is wounded. Luckily you can heal him.
e_sen30_c_rp0_s=You cure the child and give him some supplies so that he can return home safely.<br><br>Before leaving, he tells you that he found a chest in the hole and that's why he was there. He gives you the chest and goes back to his farm.<br><br>You are very satisfied to have fulfilled the baker's request, and you feel very good about it.
e_sen30_c_rp1=He is dead and burned by the fire you caused.
e_sen30_c_rp1_s=The poor kid is burnt to a crisp. You're not sure if he was alive before you burned him... That doesn't change the fact that he's dead.<br><br>Besides the boy, there is a half-burned chest in the hole. Perhaps that is the reason the boy was there. You bury the child and open the chest.<br><br>You told the baker that you would find his son, and you found him... But you are sure that it was not the result he expected when he asked for your help.
e_sen31_a_nm=The moon ritual
e_sen31_a_dsc=You discover a forest glade, and here you can see some menhirs placed in a peculiar way, forming a circle. Inside the circle, there is an altar of some kind, at which an elder dryad performs a strange ritual.<br><br>On the altar are some pieces of gold and a shiny white stone that seems to channel the moonlight.<br><br>The dryad has not yet realized that you are close, but it will surely protect the moonstone at all costs.
e_sen31_a_dsca=You can wait for the ritual to end or interrupt it...
e_sen31_a_rp0=Wait in a safe place for the ritual to end and take what may be left.
e_sen31_a_rp0_s=You wait a bit until the moon begins to set, then you see how the dryad takes the stone and leaves.<br><br>Lucky for you, she left the gold and some items behind.
e_sen31_a_rp1=You're not sure why...but you want that shiny stone, so you attack the dryad.
e_sen31_a_rp1_s=She sees you charging at her and prepares to fight.
e_sen31_a_rp2=You try to distract the dryad and then try steal the shiny stone.
e_sen31_a_rp2_s=You make noise behind a bush and the dryad is confused for a moment. That's when you pick up the shiny stone and run without looking back.<br><br>Surprisingly, the plan worked and you got the moonstone, even though you have no use for it.

Could you teach me a spell to defend myself?"<br><br>The dryad is a bit surprised but seeing that Ottis seems honest she agrees to teach him a spell.<br><br>But then she realizes that the rest of you want to take advantage to steal the shiny stone from her and casts moonfire on poor Ottis, and the fight starts.

e_sen33_a_rp2_s=You have learned from your past experience with the baker's son death.

e_sen33_a_rp3_fc=The dryad spotted you as you moved carelessly through the forest.<br><br>Furious, she casts a starfall spell on you, and you get burned. You can't rest, and your only option is to fight while you're still burning.

e_sen33_a_rp4_f=The dryad has detected you trying to flank her.<br><br>She casts a moonfire spell near you causing some bushes and your clothes to catch fire. You can't stop to put out the fire and you have to fight to defend yourselves.
e_sen33_a_rp4_fc=You take the wrong path and instead of flanking them, you go out into the open right in front of the dryad...<br><br>Furious, she casts a starfall spell on you. You take damage and are burned. There is no choice but to fight with this disadvantage.

e_sen33_a_rp5_s=Bree steps forward staring at the dryad, then at the trunky and finally at Ylmer, saying:<br><br>"Ohh...old friend...

What have you become.<br><br>You two, I relieve you of your guard duty, get out of here."<br><br>The trunky and dryad, tainted by the obelisk, refuse to leave and you quickly join Bree to confront Ylmer.

e_sen35_a_rp3_s=You all distract the jeweler as Thuls gets behind him and steals a small bag of coins.<br><br>After that, you hurry to leave before he realizes that he is missing the coins.
e_sen35_a_rp4=As a fellow craftsman, I demand a 300g discount for the rings.
e_sen35_a_rp4_s=Wilbur and the jeweler start arguing like two grumpy old men. After a while, and just to be left alone, the jeweler accepts the deal and sells you the rings for 300g.

As the farmer told you, there is a group of sheep grazing, and among them you see a larger sheep with golden wool.<br><br>That must be the legendary golden sheep!

e_sen39_a_rp0_s=(Farmer) "As the locals know, the legendary golden sheep is a magical sheep that appears rarely with other grazing sheep and protects them.

e_velka18_a_dsc=After facing several dangers, you have already traveled halfway. Now it is time to climb to the top of the volcano.<br><br>You find a campsite that looks like someone has used recently, but it looks like that person has already left.

e_velka18_b_nm=Express delivery
e_velka18_b_dsc=You arrive at a camp and see another squid-head resting. As you approach, he says:<br><br>"Hello, adventurers. I see you have met my brother. I am Nezglekt, first mate of the Tsnemo's merchant ship, on a mission to reconnoiter these lands and collect interesting objects. I already have a delivery ready, but I am exhausted from the heat.<br><br>I see in your future that you will meet Captain Tsnemo. If you bring him this package from me, I will be able to accompany you on your future travels."
e_velka18_b_dsca=Only one of you can carry the package in its accessory slot.
e_velka18_b_rp0=You decide not to help him and get some rest.
e_velka18_b_rp0_s=You tell him that you don't have time to carry a package and rest for a while at the campsite.
e_velka18_b_rp1=I will carry the heavy package.
e_velka18_b_rp1_s=You take the package and promise to deliver it.<br><br>Before you leave you rest a bit. Nezglekt tells you that you'll find a recipient either in the void between worlds or in a vampire castle beyond a dark forest and gives you some magic shards for your trouble.
e_velka20_a_nm=The fire bazaar
e_velka20_a_dsc=On the side of the mountain, you find a small bazaar that seems to specialize in articles related to fire.<br><br>Taking a first look, you see very interesting articles, but it gives you the feeling that they are going to overcharge you for them.<br><br>You could try to bargain, so that at least the price is right.
e_velka20_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar26_a_dsca
e_velka20_a_rp0=Look at the wares before you leave.

e_velka21_a_nm=The crane
e_velka21_a_dsc=You arrive at a place with a mechanical crane that communicates with somewhere down the mountain.<br><br>This appears to be the way the nearby bazaar and cultists' resupply. The crane is fully loaded and there is a supply ready to go up.<br><br>The problem is that to activate the crane, you have to enter a code using a keypad.
e_velka21_a_dsca=Lifting the cable manually would require a lot of force...
e_velka21_a_rp0=Go away, you don't have time to enter random codes.
e_velka21_a_rp0_s=You leave the site, wondering what could be in the shipment.
e_velka21_a_rp1=Pull the cable with all your might.
e_velka21_a_rp1_s=You have done it! After a long time and now exhausted, you have uploaded the shipment.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_a_rp1_sc=You made it! After a long time and now exhausted, you have uploaded the shipment.<br><br>It seems that today's shipment is more loaded than usual. You open it and find a lot of gold, items and some obsidians ingots.
e_velka21_a_rp1_f=You do not have enough strength to lift it. Before taking more risks and injuring yourself, you let go of the cable and leave.
e_velka21_a_rp1_fc=You try to pull the cable with all your strength, but the weight is too much for you. You don't let go in time, and you fall down the cliff to a small ledge.<br><br>You have hurt yourselves badly by falling. Now you will slowly climb up the cable to be able to continue your journey.
e_velka21_a_rp2=You know the code, "457" or so said the drunken cultist.
e_velka21_a_rp2_s=The code works and the crane lifts the shipment.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_a_rp3=Beep... I can hack it.
e_velka21_a_rp3_s=Heiner pulls a cable out of its side and connects to the crane. Shortly after, the crane is activated and lifts the shipment.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_a_rp4=Let me examine the keypad.
e_velka21_a_rp4_s=Wilbur carefully examines the keypad and deduces that the most worn numbers are the ones that have been used the most.<br><br>On his first attempt, he types in 4 5 7...and eureka! The crane activates and lifts the shipment.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_a_rp5=I will pull up the cargo!
e_velka21_a_rp5_s=Bree grabs the cable with both hands and, with all her strength, pulls the load up.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_b_nm=The obsidian shipment
e_velka21_b_dsc=You arrive at a place with a mechanical crane and see that there is a group of cultists unloading a shipment of supplies and common items.<br><br>When they finish, the cultists begin loading the crane with magic shards and obsidian ingots.<br><br>You assume that this is how the cultists in this area survive, trading supplies for obsidian mined from the volcano.
e_velka21_b_dsca=They haven't finished loading the crane yet, it might be a good time to ambush them and take all the loot.
e_velka21_b_rp0=Ignore them and move on now that they are distracted.
e_velka21_b_rp0_s=The cultists see you... But since they are busy, they prefer to stay out of trouble and let you go.
e_velka21_b_rp1=Hide and attack them by surprise.
e_velka21_b_rp1_s=You hide perfectly and are ready to attack.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp1_sc=You find the perfect place to hide, and when you attack they won't see you coming. It will be a perfect ambush.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp1_f=You try to hide, but a little fiend sees you and raises the alarm. You have no choice but to go out in the open and defend yourselves.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you will collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp1_fc=You try to hide. But then a pyromancer sees you, and instead of raising the alarm he approaches the crane and sends the obsidian charge down. Suddenly, he launches a fireball towards your position that hits you.<br><br>At the end of the fight, if you survive, you will take the supplies and shards with you, but you have lost the obsidian cargo.
e_velka21_b_rp2=Argh! I'll push one over the mountain!
e_velka21_b_rp2_s=Grukli charges at a cultist who was on the edge of the mountain and pushes him down the mountain. The other cultists are dazed by what just happened, and you join Grukli to end the fight.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp2_f=Grukli charges at a cultist who was on the edge of the mountain, but the cultist sees him and dodges. It is Grukli who almost fell off the mountain, and although it is not usual for him, he really freaks out for a moment. The cultists prepare to attack him, and you join him to start the fight.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp3=I will mind control one of them...
e_velka21_b_rp3_s=Nezglekt focuses on a Firebrander, as he is the one who seems the dumbest of them, and manages to control him. He then forces him to throw himself down the mountain. The other cultists are surprised by what happened, but they realize that you are there and the fight begins.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp3_f=Nezglekt focuses on a Pyromancer, but it wasn't the best target and he gets rid of the mind control, realizes what Nezglekt was trying to do and throws a fireball that hits him. The fight begins.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka22_a_nm=The lava cascade
e_velka22_a_dsc=You are in front of a large lava cascade. If you manage to climb it, you would reach the top of the volcano, but it seems very dangerous.<br><br>In the middle of the cascade, you realize that there is a chest half burned by the flames, but reaching it is also difficult.<br><br>Doing both at the same time seems almost impossible.
e_velka22_a_dsca=rptd_e_secta6_a_dsca
e_velka22_a_rp0=You don't want to end up scorched, you leave.

e_velka22_a_rp1_f=You start to climb, but the terrain is unstable and the heat is becoming more and more intense. Before burning, you prefer to go back down.
e_velka22_a_rp1_fc=You made a wrong step and got burned by the lava... You have no choice but to go back down.
e_velka22_a_rp2=Ignore the chest and try to climb to the top.
e_velka22_a_rp2_s=You reached the top of the volcano.
e_velka22_a_rp2_sc=On your way up, you saw the opportunity and took the chance to take the chest with you.<br><br>You open the chest.

e_velka22_b_nm=How to boil an egg
e_velka22_b_dsc=You find yourself in front of a large lava cascade, but you can see that climbing it is really dangerous.<br><br>Then you notice that the mosquito egg in your rucksack moves because of the heat, or so you think.<br><br>This could be a good place to try to hatch the egg, but also to cook it. You haven't eaten anything since you left the town and you're getting hungry...
e_velka22_b_dsca=Do you want to cook it or do you want to try to hatch it?
e_velka22_b_rp0=Take out a small pot and boil the egg.
e_velka22_b_rp0_s=You take out a small pot and cook the egg near the lava until it looks edible.<br><br>Although the texture was a bit weird, it was delicious!<br><br>While you were eating it, you were able to study a safe way up the lava cascade.
e_velka22_b_rp1=Place the egg near the lava to hatch.
e_velka22_b_rp1_s=After a while a small mosquito hatches from the egg.<br><br>On its first test flight it hits a small chest in the lava waterfall and the chest falls towards you. The mosquito comes back to you and starts to follow you if you let it.<br><br>You have also seen a safe way up the lava waterfall.
e_velka25_a_nm=The Burning Hand
e_velka25_a_dsc=You enter the cultists' main base, where you meet their high chancellor, Erekhal, along with a few cultists waiting for his order to attack you.<br><br>Erekhal seems willing to see what you want from him.<br><br>You have entered their base and killed many cultists along the way to get here, so there is no chance of leaving without a fight.
e_velka25_a_dsca=What are you going to do?
e_velka25_a_rp0=You don't say anything and you attack him.
e_velka25_a_rp0_s=The fight begins.
e_velka25_a_rp1=Who are you? I have the real chancellor's staff!
e_velka25_a_rp1_s=(Erekhal) "Ohh, poor Cornelius... Are you so old that you don't even recognize your apprentice?<br><br>You left a long time ago and abandoned us. You have no right to come back!<br><br>Now, I am the high chancellor and leader of the Burning Hand."<br><br>Erekhal gestures to his minions... But they hesitate to face Cornelius and retreat. Still, Erekhal prepares to fight.
e_velka25_a_rp2=We will end you and your cult!
e_velka25_a_rp2_s=Magnus's threatening roar scares a fleeing cultist and the others are left a bit stunned.<br><br>The fight starts.
e_velka25_a_rp2_f=Magnus's words only manage to enrage the cultists rather than scare them.<br><br>The fight begins.
e_velka25_a_rp3=Sss... I can try to assassinate him.
e_velka25_a_rp3_s=In one swift maneuver, Thuls sneaks up behind Erekhal and stabs him. It's not enough to kill him, but it leaves him quite weakened.<br><br>The fight begins.
e_velka25_a_rp3_f=One of the cultists detects Thuls and throws a fireball at him. The assassination attempt fails and only enrages the cultists.<br><br>The fight begins.
e_velka25_a_rp4=I remember you... You are the apprentice of that fire mage.
e_velka25_a_rp4_s=(Erekhal) "Your name was Wilbur, right? I'm no longer that naive brat who followed his master around...<br><br>I'm the leader of the Burning Hand! And now I'm much more powerful than him!<br><br>I'll prove it to you..."<br><br>As Erekhal spoke Wilbur made sure to cast a water spell to protect everyone from Erekhal's fire spells.
e_velka25_b_nm=rptd_e_velka25_a_nm
e_velka25_b_dsc=You enter the cultists' main base where you meet their high chancellor, Erekhal, along with a few cultists waiting for his order to attack you.<br><br>You notice that Erekhal is carrying the staff that the old man asked you to retrieve.<br><br>You have entered their base and killed many cultists along the way to get here, so there is no chance of leaving without a fight.
e_velka25_b_dsca=rptd_e_velka25_a_dsca
e_velka25_b_rp0=An old man asked us to come get that staff, so kindly give it to us.
e_velka25_b_rp0_s=(Erekhal) "Hmm... So you met the old man... I was hoping he was already dead.<br><br>Never mind. Now I am the leader of the Burning Hand!"<br><br>Erekhal gestures to his minions and prepares to fight.
e_velka25_b_rp1=I promised an old man that I would bring him back that staff you carry
e_velka25_b_rp1_s=(Erekhal) "You, you aren't that child... It can't be...<br><br>So you met the old man... I was hoping he was already dead.<br><br>Never mind. Now I am the leader of the Burning Hand!"<br><br>Erekhal gestures to his minions and prepares to fight.
e_velka25_c_nm=The cult dissolves
e_velka25_c_dsc=With the death of Erekhal, there is no one left to lead the cult of the Burning Hand.<br><br>After your passage through Velkarath decimating their ranks and the death of their leader, the few remaining cultists flee, and the cult is dissolved.
e_velka25_c_dsca=Now you can take a little break and loot what's left at its base.

e_velka25_c_rp1_s=In addition to the staff that the old man wanted, at the base you find a large chest with gold and many of the objects that the cultists used.<br><br>You honored the promise you made to the old man on the bridge.

e_velka26_a_nm=Elemental brawl
e_velka26_a_dsc=You arrive at some strange ruins, where three different groups of elementals fight to try to activate and take control of a statue that is in the center.<br><br>They appear to be deadlocked, and none of the groups manages to gain ground from the others.<br><br>Perhaps helping one of them could break the deadlock, and the winner could thank you in some way.
e_velka26_a_dsca=Who do you want to help?
e_velka26_a_rp0=Ignore them.
e_velka26_a_rp0_s=You continue your way to the top of the volcano.
e_velka26_a_rp1=Help the lava elementals.

e_velka26_a2_rp0=The lava elementals activate the statue.

e_velka26_a2_rp1=The stone elementals activate the statue.
e_velka26_a2_rp1_s=The statue breaks and a lot of magic shards appear from it. The stone elementals do not seem to mind that you take all of them.
e_velka26_a2_rp2=The obsidian elementals activate the statue.
e_velka26_a2_rp2_s=The statue is activated but nothing happens. It seems that the statue was already theirs from the beginning.<br><br>One of the elementals drops a chunk of gold at your feet in thanks.
e_velka26_b_nm=The mysterious throne
e_velka26_b_dsc=You arrive at some ancient ruins and, after investigating for a while, you find a room with three glyphs on the floor, a throne at the end of the room and a mural above the throne.<br><br>According to the images on the mural, you believe that a ritual was performed here in which one person sat on the throne while three others were placed on top of each glyph. Then the throne was activated and made the person on the throne ascend or gave him some kind of power.
e_velka26_b_dsca=Do you want to try to perform the ritual, and if so, who will sit on the throne?
e_velka26_b_rp0=Better not to take the risk and leave.

e_velka26_b_rp1=I shall sit on the throne!
e_velka26_b_rp1_s=You perform the ritual as indicated on the mural and the throne is activated. At that moment, you all feel refreshed and the one on the throne has the feeling of being able to perform his combat skills more times than usual.<br><br>As you sat on the throne, a secret compartment opened on one side of the room.

e_velka7_c_dsca=You say goodbye to the merchant.
e_velka7_c_rp0=You take the gold and the card and leave.

e_velka8_a_dsca=Party time!
e_velka8_a_rp0=Pass discreetly through the banquet and head east.
e_velka8_a_rp0_s=It has not been very difficult not to attract attention.
e_velka8_a_rp0_sc=It was not very difficult not to attract attention. Before leaving you took the opportunity to get some food and recover some health.
e_velka8_a_rp0_f=You don't know how...but you got into a fight with some drunken cultists on your way out.
e_velka8_a_rp0_fc=You don't know how...but you trip and fall in front of some drunks, who laugh at you and start hitting you.
e_velka8_a_rp1=Crash the party! Kill them now while they are drunk.
e_velka8_a_rp1_s=You draw your weapons and attack them.
e_velka8_a_rp2=Let's drink!
e_velka8_a_rp2_s=When you were playing a drinking game, one of the cultists spelled something curious: "457".<br><br>You don't know what those numbers are for...but they seem important.

e_velka9_a1_dsca=It is up to you to go in and face the beast.
e_velka9_a1_rp0=This sounds very dangerous, so you leave.
e_velka9_a1_rp0_s=As you leave, you keep hearing the growls of the furious creature.
e_velka9_a1_rp1=Go in and fight the beast.

e_voidhigh13_a_nm=The moment of truth
e_voidhigh13_a_dsc=You reach the inner sanctum of the obelisk, but it is too late. Any ritual that has been performed here is already over.<br><br>After a quick glance around the room, you can see the body of the princess behind the altar. It seems she is still alive...<br><br>Then your eyes focus on the shadowy figure in front of the altar. It is Lord Hanshek. The brooch on his neck glows brightly and a dark energy emanates from it. He looks at you and gives you a sinister smile.
e_voidhigh13_a_dsca=The moment of truth has come.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp0=I served under you in the Wolf Wars to protect the kingdom. Why do you betray it now?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp0_s=(Hanshek) "Tough luck, captain. This is beyond you... Although, I suppose I should thank you, since it was you, who helped me recover this gem in the Wolf Wars.<br><br>After extensive research, I discovered that with the gem and the blood of an Architect, I could have a power greater than Queen Amelia herself. Who turned out to be a descendant of the architects.<br><br>Unfortunately, the queen has always been out of my reach, but not the princess...<br><br>Now, at last, that power is mine!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp1=Beep... I must protect friends, beep... I must rescue the princess.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp1_s=(Hanshek) "Interesting... I never thought I'd see an active war golem again...<br><br>The same power with which the queen created and fueled the golems is mine now. It seems that his power source has been altered and is no longer what it was... So it's of no use to me.<br><br>I'll have to destroy it, along with the rest of you."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp2=I can already imagine the feast of fish and beer, grrr... You there, give us back the princess!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp2_s=(Hanshek) "So, you're just a simpleton who comes looking for a reward?<br><br>Well then, if you're looking for an early death that's what you'll get.<br><br>Time to test my new powers!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp3=You are the one who activated Senenthia's Obelisk, corrupting the forest and my friend Ylmer!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp3_s=(Hanshek) "Mmm... Ylmer? You mean that old tree in the Senenthia forest? That poor tree was already in a deep sleep and half dead when I passed by.<br><br>Activating the Obelisks was a necessary means to reach the void and complete my objective. The corruption coming out of them that you saw in the forest will also gradually take over all the realms...<br><br>Rest assured you won't be here to see it!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp4=You always struck me as a despicable guy. Looks like I won a bet with my brother
e_voidhigh13_a_rp4_s=(Hanshek) "Well, if it isn't the youngest of the Casthaks, always hiding in the woods and meddling in matters that are none of his business.<br><br>How ironic. You almost foiled my plans in the past... You were lucky that your family's great influence and your brother convinced me... Otherwise, I would have dealt with you by now.<br><br>Well boy, this isn't Senenthia... And it's time to test my new power!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp5=Sss... I usually only kill for work... Sss... But this time I'm going to enjoy it.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp5_s=(Hanshek) "What an inferior creature... You cannot comprehend the magnitude of what has happened here and the powers I have just gained.<br><br>I would tell you to go back to your swamp... But this is a perfect opportunity to test my new powers."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp6=You! You're the one to blame for bringing that thing back, freezing all my people!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp6_s=(Hanshek) "What are you talking about? I just activated the obelisk and went on my way.<br><br>You elves, always condescending, arrogant and blaming others... You look like a young elf who just came out of the forest and knows nothing about the world.<br><br>Listen young lady, this place and this magic I just obtained predates the elves and is much more powerful. It's a shame... But you won't be able to go back to your forest."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp7=So you're the bad guy in my epic tale? This battle will be legendary. It's showtime!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp7_s=(Hanshek) "And what are you supposed to be, a singing frog? What a joke.<br><br>I don't have time for this nonsense... But your companions seem to be a threat, so I'll have to finish you off with my new powers."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp8=We grew up together. You were like a big brother... Why did you kidnap the princess?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp8_s=(Hanshek) "Evelyn, you should know better than anyone... Queen Amelia's great magic power was not normal.<br><br>I always wanted that power for myself and after long years of study and this gem, I discovered that the queen was a descendant of the architects and magic ran through her ancient blood.<br><br>The queen was never within my reach, but a few days ago, on her anniversary, the princess awakened that same power. So I took the opportunity to bring her to this ancient place and with a ritual, take away her power."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp9=Seeking power at all costs will do you no good... But fear not, my flames will consume your darkness.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp9_s=(Hanshek) "Hypocritical words coming from the summoner of demons and founder of the Burning Hand...<br><br>You may have had a lot of power in your prime that could've easily taken me down, but now you're just a decrepit old man, and your flames are no longer a threat.<br><br>Prepare to succumb to a power greater than you've ever had!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp10=What an interesting place, can you explain what ritual you did to document it?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp10_s=(Hanshek) "I never expected to meet a gnome here of all places... And that flying machine also caught my eye. Maybe I'll keep it when I'm done with you.<br><br>As for the ritual, it's all thanks to this gem and the blood of the princess, a direct descendant of the architects... But someone who is about to die doesn't need to know anything else."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp11=Interesting dark magic you've obtained... But you're a fool and you'll find out soon enough
e_voidhigh13_a_rp11_s=(Hanshek) "You're just a rat. How can you presuppose that your knowledge of dark magic is greater than mine?<br><br>I will show you the great dark power I have obtained and how insignificant you are in comparison."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp12=I thought we were friends, I respected you... What have you done to the princess?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp12_s=(Hanshek) "Reginald, I have always held you in high esteem. You were one of the few I could have a normal conversation with in Senenthia.<br><br>But ever since I saw the queen's great powers, I wanted that power for myself. Now, thanks to this gem and the blood of the princess, that power is mine.<br><br>The princess is only unconscious, but I'm afraid now I have to finish you off old friend..."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp13=Oink... I can feel that gem you're wearing is bad news... You should get rid of it.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp13_s=(Hanshek) "You ignorant swine! This gem is the source of my new power, and neither you nor anyone else will separate me from it.<br><br>I will show you that I am the only one who can bring out its full potential and I will finish you."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp14=It's too late for you... You're cursed and being controlled by that gem.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp14_s=(Hanshek) "Speak for yourself... What can a swamp witch like you know about curses when she doesn't see the truth about herself?<br><br>This gem is the source of a power you cannot comprehend, but rest assured I will now show you what it is capable of."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp15=After seeing the destruction that power has caused to this place... You foolish human...
e_voidhigh13_a_rp15_s=(Hanshek) "Don't try to get into my mind, squid! It is futile. I know what you are.<br><br>A race that travels worlds and planes at ease, only to steal the relics from their inhabitants to sell elsewhere is no less foolish.<br><br>I will show you what we are capable of!"

e_voidhigh6_a_nm=The colored runes
e_voidhigh6_a_dsc=You arrive at some strange circular ruins. In the center, you can see a magic circle and around it you see twelve plates.

e_voidhigh6_a_rp3_s=When you go to press the last rune, you realize that the purple gem is missing, Tsnemo forgot to tell you this small detail...<br><br>To try your luck, you press the rune next to it to see what happens.

e_voidhigh6_a_rp4=Place the purple gem in the runic slot and press yellow, green and purple.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp4_s=When you press the last rune, the magic circle lights up and a strange energy emanates from it.<br><br>As Tsnemo told you, you place yourself in the center and take the opportunity to meditate.<br><br>When you finish the meditation, you feel relaxed and with more energy to start the next fight. (Initial energy +1)
e_voidhigh6_a_rp5=As the demon summoning guide says, you press black, orange and red.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp5_s=When you press the last rune, the magic circle lights up and a demon from hell is summoned.<br><br>The demon does not seem hostile. It approaches you and offers you an ancient artifact of incredible quality.<br><br>Furthermore, he bows to you and offers to serve you if you accept him.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp6=As the innkeeper at the Happy Owl told you, you press green, yellow and blue.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp6_s=When the last rune is pressed, the magic circle lights up and a large number of supply boxes appear.<br><br>The story of the Happy Owl innkeeper's grandfather was true.

e_voidlow14_a_nm=The sacred forge
e_voidlow14_a_dsc=You encounter a white construct hitting an anvil with a hammer, and next to it you can see an inactive Oddball. As you approach it, it says to you:<br><br>"Fear not, I am a blacksmith who loves working with platinum. Right now, I was trying to fix this Oddball, but I lack another type of metal to fix its damaged dark side.<br><br>I'm also very good at forging magical items, like this platinum ring that you can keep, but if you give me some kind of rare material, I'll make you something even more impressive."
e_voidlow14_a_dsca=Do you have something he can use to forge an item?
e_voidlow14_a_rp0=You take the ring and thank him.
e_voidlow14_a_rp0_s=As you have nothing to give him, you take the ring and thank him before leaving.
e_voidlow14_a_rp1=You offer him the large emerald.
e_voidlow14_a_rp1_s=He takes the emerald and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic staff and the platinum ring.<br><br>You thank him before you leave.
e_voidlow14_a_rp2=You offer him the huge ruby.
e_voidlow14_a_rp2_s=He takes the ruby and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic armor and the platinum ring.<br><br>You thank him before you leave.
e_voidlow14_a_rp3=You offer him the magic sapphire.
e_voidlow14_a_rp3_s=He takes the sapphire and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic amulet and the platinum ring.<br><br>You thank him before you leave.
e_voidlow14_a_rp4=You offer him the golden wool.
e_voidlow14_a_rp4_s=He takes the wool and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic cloak and the platinum ring.<br><br>You thank him before you leave.
e_voidlow14_a_rp5=You offer him the obsidian ingots.
e_voidlow14_a_rp5_s=He takes the obsidian and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic dagger and the platinum ring.<br><br>With the leftover obsidian he forges a strange component that fits into the broken Oddball.<br><br>When activated, the Oddball seems harmless and starts to follow you. The construct says goodbye and lets you keep the Oddball.

e_voidlow15_a_dsc=You arrive at a place that already has some tents set up and seems uninhabited.<br><br>In the distance, you can see a large tower with stairs.

The chest is locked and sealed with magic. It seems impossible to open unless you have the key.
e_voidlow16_a_dsca=So unless you have the key, you settle for the rest of the treasure.
e_voidlow16_a_rp0=You search in the treasure and take as much as you can.
e_voidlow16_a_rp0_s=In the treasure, you find many unique items that can be useful to you. You also collect as much gold as you can carry.
e_voidlow16_a_rp1=You use the key to open the jade chest.
e_voidlow16_a_rp1_s=Inside, you find only an old straw hat and a note that reads:<br><br>"The greatest treasure of all is the friends you've made along the way.<br><br>-- Nook, the treasure hunter."<br><br>After being stunned for a moment, you burst out laughing and decide to pick up the rest of the treasure.

e_voidlow21_a_rp0_s=The book tells how the ancient race known as the architects rebelled against their rulers, the three archons.<br><br>It is written that, after centuries of ruling, the archons became corrupt and created powerful artifacts capable of destroying worlds. The architects opposed this and after a great war managed to imprison each archon in a magic gem.

e_voidlow21_a_rp1=Take some scrolls of intellect.
e_voidlow21_a_rp1_s=You decide to search through all the books and scrolls, and take a scroll of intellect for each of you.<br><br>Then, you leave the library.

e_voidlow21_a_rp2_s=You decide to search through all the books and scrolls, and take a scroll of defense for each of you.<br><br>Then, you leave the library.

e_voidlow21_a_rp5_s=You've never seen Wilbur so excited... He keeps moving from one place to another, searching through the piles of books and dust.<br><br>Unfortunately for him, it's time to go, so you force Wilbur to keep just one book for the road and leave.
e_voidlow21_a_rp6=Look what I found hidden! Now it's mine.

e_voidlow21_a_rp7=Search for a copy of the book "Demon summoning guide".
e_voidlow21_a_rp7_s=It's incredible, you have found it, an intact copy! You know the first two colors, black and orange, so you read on to discover the third.<br><br>"The third color of hell is red.

e_voidlow24_a_rp0_s=You tell him that you are not interested, that you have no gold to spare and you walk away from the ship.
e_voidlow24_a_rp1=Give him 400g.
e_voidlow24_a_rp1_s=Tsnemo tells you that these are the ruins of an ancient civilization known as the architects and that, after a great war against their rulers, their kingdom was destroyed.<br><br>He also tells you that if you want to go to the upper ruins, you will have to face two colossal automatons and that you had better protect yourselves against holy damage.
e_voidlow24_a_rp2=Give him 800g.
e_voidlow24_a_rp2_s=Tsnemo tells you that if you want to go to the upper ruins, you will have to face two colossal automatons and that you had better protect yourselves against holy damage.<br><br>He also tells you that there is a place that is perfect for meditation in the upper ruins.

e_voidlow24_a_rp3=Give him 1,200g.

e_voidlow25_a_nm=The twins
e_voidlow25_a_dsc=You are at the base of the great staircase, but in front of you there are two colossal automatons blocking your way.<br><br>The automatons do not attack you immediately.

e_voidlow25_a_rp0=You attack them directly.
e_voidlow25_a_rp0_s=As you approach, they stand on guard and the fight begins.
e_voidlow25_a_rp1=You try to rest and recover your strength.
e_voidlow25_a_rp1_s=While you are resting, you see how the automatons reinforce themselves and increase their defenses.<br><br>Before it is too late and without wasting any more time, you decide to attack them.
e_voidlow25_a_rp2=As Tsnemo told you, you make sure to prepare your holy defenses.
e_voidlow25_a_rp2_s=Before the combat starts, you make sure to cast a spell of protection against holy damage and rest for a while.
e_voidlow25_b_nm=The twins fall
e_voidlow25_b_dsc=After a hard fight, you have defeated the two colossal automatons and the way to the stairs is clear.<br><br>Before you start the ascent, you notice that there is a large ancient chest on one side of the tower.

e_voidlow26_a_dsc=In front of you, there is a staircase that reaches as far as the eye can see.

e_voidlow5_a_nm=The two armies
e_voidlow5_a_dsc=You arrive at some ruins where it seems that many battles have been fought. There are only two paths to move forward, and each one is protected by an army of constructs.<br><br>To the north is the white army and to the south is the black army.
e_voidlow5_a_dsca=If you want to advance you must decide which army to fight.
e_voidlow5_a_rp0=Go north and fight the white constructs.

e_voidlow5_a_rp1=Go south and fight the black constructs.
e_voidlow5_a_rp1_s=You decide to face the black army. The fight begins.
e_voidlow6_a_nm=The white statue
e_voidlow6_a_dsc=After defeating the constructs, you find a large white statue. When you examine it, you see that it has a keyhole in the center.<br><br>The magic bridge that connects the ruins seems to be weakened. You imagine that somehow the statue serves to reactivate it and access the central ruins, otherwise it would be impossible to get there.<br><br>Luckily, there is another path that would allow you to move forward, but it leads you away from the central ruins.
e_voidlow6_a_dsca=The only way to continue to the center is to have the key or somehow pick the lock.
e_voidlow6_a_rp0=You are leaving, since you don't have the key.
e_voidlow6_a_rp0_s=As there is nothing you can do, you take the other path.
e_voidlow6_a_rp1=You use the white key in the lock.
e_voidlow6_a_rp1_s=The key works perfectly and you hear a click. Then you see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2=You try to pick the lock somehow.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_s=Incredibly, after tinkering with the lock for a while, you hear a click. Then you see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_sc=Incredibly, after tinkering with the lock for a while, you hear a click. Then you see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.<br><br>In addition, you have opened a secret compartment of the statue in which you have found quite a few magic shards.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_f=After tinkering with the lock for a while, nothing useful happens and you have no choice but to leave rather disappointed.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_fc=After tinkering with the lock for a while, you hear a click...but something is wrong... Suddenly, the statue discharges a strong electric current that electrocutes you.
e_voidlow6_a_rp3=Sss... I can try to pick the lock.
e_voidlow6_a_rp3_s=Thuls pulls out a lock pick and manages to pick the lock. You see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.
e_voidlow6_a_rp3_f=Thuls pulls out a lock pick, but fails to pick the lock. Thuls feels a bit humiliated and you have no choice but to leave.
e_voidlow6_a_rp4=Well, just this once... You can get on.
e_voidlow6_a_rp4_s=If you decide to go to the other side, Wilbur allows you to get on his flying platform and, one by one, he takes you to the central ruins.

e_challengelow_13_nm=Tavern in the mist
e_challengelow_13_dsc=A very thick fog rises in front of you. As you move forward, a tavern appears out of nowhere.<br><br>You decide to enter, and then you see the tavern keeper who says to you:<br><br>"Welcome, it's good to see new faces! What brings you here? Do you want a drink? If you want I can also sell you some personalized cups along with your drinks."
e_challengelow_13_dsca=rptd_e_aquar13_a_dsca
e_challengelow_13_rp0=You rest for a moment and leave.
e_challengelow_13_rp0_s=You sit down for a moment and politely tell the tavern keeper that you don't want anything.<br><br>You leave before abusing the hospitality.
e_challengelow_13_rp1=You buy some drinks for 200g.
e_challengelow_13_rp1_s=The drinks are very refreshing, and you recover your strength.<br><br>Then the tavern keeper shows you his wide range of cups.
e_challengelow_13_rp2=You buy the highest quality drinks for 1,000g.
e_challengelow_13_rp2_s=The tavern keeper brings you his best drinks. They are very tasty, and besides recovering your strength you are also very satisfied.<br><br>As the tavern keeper is happy for the great expense you have made, he sells you his cups at a 50% discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3=You are only interested in the cups and would like a discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3_s=The tavern keeper has taken a liking to you and although you don't want drinks, he agrees to sell you his cups at a discount.<br><br>You get a 15% discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3_sc=The tavern keeper liked you very much and although you don't want drinks, he accepts to sell you his cups at a good discount.<br><br>You get a 30% discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3_f=The bartender is somewhat disappointed that you don't want drinks, yet he agrees to sell you his cups without discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3_fc=Unwittingly, you have managed to anger the tavern keeper. He offers you nothing and throws you out of the tavern.<br><br>You leave rather disappointed.
e_sen21_c_nm=The pigmen congregation
e_sen21_c_dsc=You arrive at a chapel near the river.<br><br>The door is ajar and as you peek inside you see a group of pigmen attending some sort of mass.<br><br>You are struck by the fact that the pigman who is officiating the mass is dressed in a pope's costume.
e_sen21_c_dsca=rptd_e_aquar13_a_dsca
e_sen21_c_rp0=You don't want to bother them and you leave.
e_sen21_c_rp0_s=rptd_e_sen21_a_rp0_s
e_sen21_c_rp1=You enter to attend the mass.
e_sen21_c_rp1_s=You enter trying not to attract too much attention, but when Yogger enters the door the pigmen panic.<br><br>Chaos takes over the church and all the pigmen stumble out wherever they can.<br><br>In a moment, the church is empty... So you take the opportunity to grab some of the objects left behind by the pigmen.
e_sen21_c_rp2=Boo! I finally found you, piggy!
e_sen21_c_rp2_s=When the pigmen see Yogger, they panic.<br><br>While Yogger is laughing loudly, the little pig dressed as a pope disappears in the crowd of pigmen who are trying to run away stumbling out of the chapel.<br><br>In a moment, the church is empty... So you take the opportunity to grab some of the objects left behind by the pigmen.
e_sen25_a_rp11=How are you guys doing? Any news to report?
e_sen25_a_rp11_s=When the werewolves see Yogger in the group, they immediately make a place for him in the camp and share their food with him. Then they tell him that they discovered that the dryads have a big stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the objects of the dead adventurers that are lost in the forest.<br><br>Before leaving, they give you some gold that they have stolen from some peasants who were crossing the forest.
e_sen27_d_nm=The boss is back!
e_sen27_d_dsc=You arrive at a bandit camp where you see a group of werewolves looking at you threateningly.<br><br>Luckily, they realize that you are with Yogger and in a moment the atmosphere calms down.
e_sen27_d_dsca=They welcome you to the camp and you take the opportunity to rest a little.
e_sen27_d_rp0=While I'm here, I'll pick up my things
e_sen27_d_rp0_s=Yogger enters one of the camp tents and shortly after comes out with his cleaver and a few other items.<br><br>After resting for a while, you leave the camp.
e_sen27_d_rp1=Once again together... and once again I wonder... what are you fighting for?
e_sen27_d_rp1_s=(Yogger) "The truth is that I have been bored in this forest for some time. A messenger from the king found me and offered me amnesty and a good reward if I returned his daughter safely.<br><br>So here I am, but make no mistake Captain... this time we are equal, and nobody gives me orders!<br><br>While we're at it... let me show you something I've learned over the years. I'll also take the opportunity to pick up some of my stuff."
e_sen27_d_rp2=Beep... I was here a few years ago...  Damaged memory... Beep
e_sen27_d_rp2_s=(Yogger) "This old piece of metal brings back memories... I was able to play with a model that looked like yours, it was a good killing machine!<br><br>Maybe I can teach you a little trick... Besides, I'll take the opportunity to pick up my stuff."
e_sen27_d_rp3=So, you're like a chef? Do you know how to prepare fish?
e_sen27_d_rp3_s=(Yogger) "I'm more specialized in meat...<br><br>Since we have some free time, I'm going to teach you how to cut meat the best way.<br><br>Besides, I'll take the opportunity to pick up my stuff."
e_sen27_d_rp4=How the hell did I end up teaming up with the likes of you!
e_sen27_d_rp4_s=(Yogger) "You know it well little doe... you were one short of being an official search party and I was your only option.<br><br>But don't worry... the king has offered me amnesty and a good reward if I return his daughter safely. So for now, let's get along...<br><br>While we're at it, I'm going to show you a little trick of mine and take the opportunity to pick up my stuff."
e_sen27_d_rp5=Oink... I don't feel very safe and comfortable...
e_sen27_d_rp5_s=(Yogger) "Don't worry little piggy, as long as you're with me my werewolves won't touch you.<br><br>As for me... if you dare to defect from my group a second time, like you did years ago... Then I will turn you into mincemeat on the spot, and this time there will be no stopping me!<br><br>While we're here, I'll take the opportunity to pick up my stuff."
e_sen30_b_rp8=You don't expect me to pay for my own stuff... do you?
e_sen30_b_rp8_s=When the merchant sees Yogger, he becomes quite frightened. But he gradually pulls himself together and argues that not all of his merchandise is from the bandit camp... and besides, he paid them for it.<br><br>Even so, and clearly still quite frightened, he offers you a 50% discount.<br><br>You accept the discount and look at his merchandise.
e_sen33_a_rp6=I should have cut down this tree a long time ago! Now no one will stop me!
e_sen33_a_rp6_s=Yogger draws his weapon and charges at the old treant with a loud war howl.<br><br>The rest of you are motivated by the howl and follow him into battle.
e_sen45_a_nm=Yogger's diary
e_sen45_a_dsc=You explore the forest behind the camp and near a tree you find an old diary.<br><br>After a quick glance you realize that it is Yogger's diary.<br><br>The diary talks about when Yogger was young and everything that happened to him in the Wolf Wars.
e_sen45_a_dsca=Do you want to read the diary?
e_sen45_a_rp0=Read Yogger's diary.
e_sen45_a_rp0_s=(Yogger) "The war is about to begin and it is time for me to choose a side.<br><br>The werewolf side is divided... There are many who prefer to annex the kingdom and will fight for it.<br><br>Although I pretty much agree with old Chieftain Gorio... I think I can get more out of it by joining the kingdom and seeing what happens."
e_sen45_a_rp1=You don't want to read the diary.
e_sen45_a_rp1_s=You leave the diary where it was and continue on your way.
e_sen46_a_nm=The wolf cub
e_sen46_a_dsc=When you leave the bandit camp, you stop for a while to rest and assimilate everything you have read in Yogger's diary.<br><br>Thanks to it, you have discovered what happened in the Wolf Wars from the point of view of one of the most relevant characters of the war.<br><br>While you are resting, a small wolf cub appears from the nearby forest.
e_sen46_a_dsca=The wolf cub approaches you without fear and seems to have taken a liking to you.
e_sen46_a_rp0=You decided to adopt the wolf cub.
e_sen46_a_rp0_s=The wolf cub seems to be very happy that you let him go with you.<br><br>You call him Wolfy.
e_sen46_a_rp1=You don't want to take care of the wolf cub.
e_sen46_a_rp1_s=You abandon the wolf cub near the forest and continue on your way.

e_aquar8_a_rp10=You do not know who I am? Don't make me go find your boss...
e_aquar8_a_rp10_s=One of the crocomen recognizes Yogger and knows that he is friends with his boss, Irwin.<br><br>Before things get complicated the crocomen give you a boat for free. Now you can sail through the marsh.
e_aquar30_b_rp5=rptd_e_aquar30_b_rp2
e_aquar30_b_rp5_s=Grukli offers to go with Yogger... You don't really know what's going on inside, but after a while, Yogger comes out retching and annoyed.<br><br>Then Grukli comes out, blushing and with no choice but to admit that he had to live in that cave for a while... At least he brings with him some gold and magic shards.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp16=When we met at that dig, I could tell you were up to no good...
e_voidhigh13_a_rp16_s=(Hanshek) "Ohh! So the local bandit has come all the way to the end of the world... and for what?<br><br>Although I suppose I should thank you... It's thanks to you that I recovered this gem in the Wolf Wars. Besides, when the Chieftain fell you did me another favor by rebelling and taking the rest of the werewolves with you. Thanks to that, no one noticed the excavation, and I had some time to study the gem without the Queen meddling.<br><br>As a reward, I will give you a quick death!"
e_forge3_a_nm=The outer forge
e_forge3_a_dsc=On the wall of the volcano you find a dwarven forge for auxiliary works of the city. Although it is somewhat damaged, it seems to still work.<br><br>On one side of the forge, you see some obsidian ingots and some dwarf blueprints that are still intact.<br><br>Obsidian ingots are valuable in their own right, but perhaps you could try using them to craft some of the dwarven items shown on the blueprints.

e_forge4_a_nm=The flooded mine
e_forge4_a_dsc=You find the entrance to a mine that is partially flooded with lava.<br><br>At the entrance of the main tunnel, you can see that there is a large emerald in a small compartment. Also along the tunnel, you see a large amount of gold and shards.<br><br>You can go in to retrieve the emerald, as well as some gold and shards. The further you decide to go in, the more gold and shards you will have the chance to pick up, but it will be more dangerous.
e_forge4_a_dsca=How far do you want to go?
e_forge4_a_rp0=You don't want to go into the tunnel and get burned.
e_forge4_a_rp0_s=You do not waste more time and move forward.
e_forge4_a_rp1=You enter a short distance that seems safe.
e_forge4_a_rp1_s=The first thing you do when you enter the tunnel is to pick up the large emerald. Then you try to get as much gold and shards as you can without getting hurt by lava.

e_forge5_a_nm=The destroyed workshop
e_forge5_a_dsc=You arrive at a small workshop with two large ash-covered statues. The place is wrecked, full of broken dwarven machines and pieces of metal.<br><br>You search through the rubble for anything of value and find a locked box, decorated with dwarven motifs that look quite ancient.<br><br>The box does not seem exceptionally difficult to open, and you could open it with a little effort.
e_forge5_a_dsca=Do you want to try to open the box?
e_forge5_a_rp0=You decide to leave the box unopened and move on.
e_forge5_a_rp0_s=You leave the box behind and walk away.<br><br>When you pass near the statues, they activate. You suddenly realize that they weren't statues, but inactive dwarven golems covered in ash!<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge5_a_rp1=You decide to open the box.
e_forge5_a_rp1_s=Inside the box, you find a small mysterious key with a black ribbon.<br><br>Unfortunately, when opening the box, several small machines have been activated, in addition to the two large statues. You suddenly realize that they weren't statues, but inactive dwarven golems covered in ash!<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge5_a_rp2=Beep... let me analyze these statues first
e_forge5_a_rp2_s=Heiner begins to analyze the statues and sees a way to improve his lasers, then realizes that they are not statues, but dwarven golems.<br><br>At the same time, one of you impatiently opens the box and finds a small mysterious key with a black ribbon. Unfortunately, opening the box activates the golems and several machines around you.<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge5_a_rp3=Sss... let me open it!
e_forge5_a_rp3_s=Thuls opens the box carefully and realizes that there was some kind of trap set, but luckily he is skillful enough not to set it off. Inside the box, you find a small mysterious key with a black ribbon.<br><br>When you pass near the statues, they activate. You suddenly realize that they weren't statues, but inactive dwarven golems covered in ash!<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge6_a_nm=The Dwarven terminator
e_forge6_a_dsc=You see a large hole in the wall of the volcano that seems to be connected to the inner city. As you get closer, you hear an increasingly loud noise of chains and metal.<br><br>Suddenly, the chains pull a large dwarven war machine out of the hole. The machine is quite broken, but somehow its core is still active and the machine is still running.<br><br>It is clear that the war machine is hostile and that destroying it completely is the only way forward and out of the volcano.
e_forge6_a_dsca=You have to decide quickly how to deal with it.
e_forge6_a_rp0=You attack it quickly without wasting any more time.
e_forge6_a_rp0_s=Without thinking twice, you attack the dwarven war machine immediately.
e_forge6_a_rp1=Try to hide behind some rubble and rest before fighting.
e_forge6_a_rp1_s=You manage to hide and rest a bit without being detected. However, it seems that now the dwarven machine has a little more armor.
e_forge6_a_rp1_sc=You manage to hide and get some rest without being detected. You have been able to rest perfectly and it seems that there is no change in the dwarven machine.
e_forge6_a_rp1_f=You manage to hide, but when you start to rest the dwarven machine detects you. It also seems that now the dwarven machine has a little more armor.
e_forge6_a_rp1_fc=You have miserably failed to hide and the dwarven war machine launches a wave of missiles at you, which will damage you and cause severe burns.
e_forge6_a_rp2=It can't be... That thing exploded! I sacrificed so much...
e_forge6_a_rp2_s=For the first time in your adventure, you see the old wizard shudder as if he had seen a ghost. Instinctively, he takes a few steps back and casts a spell to protect the group from the fire.<br><br>Cornelius pulls himself together and the fight begins.
e_forge6_a_rp3=I'm pretty sure we destroyed that thing... This is going to be tough
e_forge6_a_rp3_s=Wilbur frowns in disbelief and tells the group that he has faced this machine before.<br><br>He then casts a water spell that soaks your clothes and prepares you for what is to come.
e_forge6_a_rp4=Beep... Danger! Danger!
e_forge6_a_rp4_s=Heiner's core begins to resonate with that of the war machine, and he can sense the impending danger!<br><br>Heiner somehow manages to reduce the machine's armor a bit and takes the opportunity to increase the group's armor before combat begins.

e_forge6_c_dsc=After a hard fight you defeat the dwarven war machine and several of its parts fall into the lava.<br><br>Luckily the cockpit and the core remain hanging from one of the chains.
e_forge6_c_dsca=Carefully you climb up to see what you can find of value.
e_forge6_c_rp0=You loot the dwarven machine.
e_forge6_c_rp0_s=Inside the cockpit, you find some gold and various valuables.<br><br>When you finish looting the remains of the dwarven machine, you break the remaining chain that holds it.<br><br>The machine falls and melts into the lava forever.
e_forge6_c_rp1=You make sure to extract the core and loot the cockpit.
e_forge6_c_rp1_s=Surprisingly the core still works. With it, you will be able to repair the golem you found in Senenthia's tower.

e_forge7_a_nm=Fresh Air

e_forge7_a_rp0_s=You continue your way to the top of the volcano.
e_forge8_a_nm=The lava fisherman
e_forge8_a_dsc=You find an old dwarf sitting on a pile of rubble on the lava. As you approach he greets you:<br><br>"Hey youngsters, you wouldn't happen to be amateur fishermen by any chance? You see, when I was young and the Forge was active, I used to come fishing in the lava of the volcano with some friends... With a little trick of ours and a steel rod, we learned to fish even lava blobs!<br><br>But now there is only me left... I often come to sit here near the lava to remember them.
e_forge8_a_dsca=So, do you like fishing or not?"
e_forge8_a_rp0=You have no time to waste talking.
e_forge8_a_rp0_s=You say goodbye to the dwarf and continue on your way.
e_forge8_a_rp1=Yes! We even fished in the frozen sea of Faeborg!
e_forge8_a_rp1_s=Passionately you answer yes, and the dwarf believes you without a moment's hesitation. He says to you:<br><br>"I see you are one of mine! It is good that there are still young fishermen left. Take these fish as a gift, although I'm a good fisherman I'm not a very good cook and the lava burned them...  Hahahahaha..."<br><br>After giving you the fish, he continues laughing and you say goodbye.
e_forge8_a_rp2=Yes! We've managed to fish in some frozen sewers!
e_forge8_a_rp2_s=rptd_e_forge8_a_rp1_s
e_forge8_a_rp3=Of course! This is our last catch.
e_forge8_a_rp3_s=The dwarf is amazed when you show him the big fish. He says to you:<br><br>"I see you are one of mine! It is good that there are still young fishermen left. Take these fish as a gift, although I'm a good fisherman I'm not a very good cook and the lava burned them...  Hahahahaha..."<br><br>After giving you the fish, he continues laughing and you say goodbye.
e_forge8_a_rp4=Fishing runs through my veins! I love it!
e_forge8_a_rp4_s=When the dwarf sees Grukli, his expression turns tender and he says:<br><br>"Ohh! A young dwarf fisherman! Besides that, you remind me a lot of a friend of mine... His name was Thorim and we used to go fishing often at the end of the shift.<br><br>I still have his old rod with me... You know what... Keep it! I'm sure you'll get more out of it than me."<br><br>You thank him and leave.
e_forge8_a_rp5=Yes! I always carry my rod with me!
e_forge8_a_rp5_s=The dwarf sees your fishing rod and is pleased. He says to you:<br><br>"I see you are one of mine! It is good that there are still young fishermen left.

e_forge8_a_rp9=Yes! Would you get me a lava blob with this rod?
e_forge8_a_rp9_s=The dwarf rejoices when he sees that you are carrying that rod with you. He says to you:<br><br>"Ohh! A fellow fisherman! It's been a while since I last tried, but don't worry, this is never forgotten!"<br><br>The dwarf uses your steel rod and when the hook touches the lava he gives it a couple of quick twists and pulls hard. A lava blob pops out of the lava and begins to follow you.<br><br>The dwarf returns the rod, you thank him and leave.

e_forge9_a_dsc=In front of you is the main entrance to the dwarven city, sealed off after the events of the Obsidian Uprising.<br><br>You would have liked to see this engineering marvel that the dwarves excavated inside the volcano, but you see no way to enter.<br><br>However, among the stones you see an old dwarven journal.
e_forge9_a_dsca=The journal is partially burned and almost impossible to read.
e_forge9_a_rp0=You try to read the dwarven journal.
e_forge9_a_rp0_s=Unfortunately, it's too burned, and you can only read a few loose fragments like "Counselor Amelia's visit" or "The fire wizard gathered his followers".<br><br>You deduce that the diary narrates the beginning of the Obsidian Uprising, but you can't get anything else clear.<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_forge9_a_rp1=You ignore the journal and continue on your way.

And the little girl, what happened to her? I cannot remember..."<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_forge9_a_rp3=This was a magnificent city...
e_forge9_a_rp3_s=(Wilbur) "I remember visiting the city when I was younger. I spent a lot of time studying the strange mechanisms of the dwarves, until the uprising broke out...<br><br>A pity. The city was a real engineering feat... not as cool as my current workshop, of course."<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_forge9_a_rp4=My mother used to tell me stories about this city
e_forge9_a_rp4_s=(Grukli) "She told me that she used to come to the city and there she fell in love with a brave dwarf... Unfortunately, she lost track of him when the uprising started and never heard from him again.<br><br>Arghhh... I miss her..."<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_forge9_a_rp5=It's a pity I didn't come a few years ago...
e_forge9_a_rp5_s=(Nezglekt) "This city looks like it used to be the perfect place to trade artifacts.<br><br>I wonder if Captain Tsnemo or any of the crew would know of a way to get in and retrieve some of them... Although I don't think any of mine could stand the heat inside."<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_sewers10_a_nm=The advisor's story
e_sewers10_a_dsc=You arrive at a palisade and find a couple of ratmen standing by some magical torches. One of them says:<br><br>"Interesting... If you are here, it means you have entered through the crack and defeated the dead.<br><br>You see, I was one of the king's advisors... One of his rings saved him from freezing and then he managed to unfreeze some of us. But soon after, he made a deal with a dracomancer named Fred, and betrayed us all...
e_sewers10_a_dsca=Well, that doesn't matter anymore. Thanks to you, we can go out. Can I do something for you?
e_sewers10_a_rp0=Could you give us one of those torches?
e_sewers10_a_rp0_s=(Ratman) "Of course, after all thanks to you, the way out is clear and we can leave.<br><br>Take one, thanks to them we have survived the intense cold. I hope they help you."<br><br>The ratman gives you the torch and then you leave.
e_sewers10_a_rp1=What was the deal the king made?
e_sewers10_a_rp1_s=(Ratman) "Fred, offered the king a lot of elven jewelry, as well as a scepter to control the dead. In exchange, the dracomancers would be free to move through the sewers and reanimate our people.<br><br>The king had become very sadistic since he learned dark magic. He liked to make dark deals with his own people...<br><br>A word of advice, if the king offers you a deal. Know that he doesn't need to extract your vitality to complete his corruption magic."
e_sewers10_a_rp2=Remember me? What happened after you exiled me?
e_sewers10_a_rp2_s=(Ratman) "Yes, I remember you... A few years after exiling you, the king became greedy and fearless of the elves. He decided to open the vault in search of power and magic items. Together with him, some of his advisors got hold of several ancient books and learned dark magic. After practicing in secret for several years, we were ready to attack the elves above when the frost surprised us.<br><br>A word of advice, I doubt you'll make a deal with him... but just in case. Know that he doesn't need to extract your vitality to complete his corruption magic.<br><br>Before you go, I apologize for exiling you. Here, take one of these magic torches, I'm sure it will come in handy."
e_sewers11_a_nm=The starving ratman
e_sewers11_a_dsc=In a corner you find a rat man looking through some crates, when he sees you, he says:<br><br>"Huh... ho... don't hurt me! I'm alive! I'm alive! Or at least for the moment... <br><br>I had to take a chance and get out of the palisade... We've run out of food and we're not going to last long. But there's nothing left here, I only found an old mysterious key and little else.
e_sewers11_a_dsca=Don't you have some food for me?"
e_sewers11_a_rp0=You share some of your normal rations.
e_sewers11_a_rp0_s=You give him some of your food and tell him that you have cleared the way out of frozen dead.<br><br>The ratman is very happy and thanks you. Before saying goodbye, he gives you the old mysterious key he found in the crates.<br><br>You also search through the crates, but as the ratman said, you find nothing of value.
e_sewers11_a_rp1=You can have this fish.
e_sewers11_a_rp1_s=You give him the fish and tell him that you have cleared the way out of frozen dead. Surprised, he says:<br><br>"Wow, how generous! Thank you so much! You see, I haven't been entirely honest... It's true that I didn't find any food in the crates, but I did find a lot of gold and shards. It's all yours, along with the mysterious key I found."<br><br>You say goodbye to him and leave.
e_sewers11_a_rp2=You can have this egg.
e_sewers11_a_rp2_s=You give him the egg and tell him that you have cleared the way out of frozen dead. Surprised, he says:<br><br>"Wow, how generous! Thank you so much!

It's all yours, along with the mysterious key I found."<br><br>You say goodbye to him and leave.
e_sewers11_a_rp5=You can have my cheese
e_sewers11_a_rp5_s=You give him your cheese and tell him that you have cleared the way out of frozen dead. Surprised, he says:<br><br>"Wow, how generous! Not only are you giving me food, but it's also cheese! You see, I haven't been entirely honest... It's true that I didn't find any food in the crates, but I did find a lot of gold and shards. It's all yours, along with the mysterious key I found.<br><br>Besides, as a thank you for the cheese, you can also have my fishing rod.

e_sewers4_a_dsc=In the center of the sewers you find a throne and next to it a frozen ratman holding a goblet. Unlike the others, this ratman still seems to be alive and with a little magic you manage to unfreeze him. When he recovers he says to you:<br><br>"Where is the king, what happened? mmm... It seems that you have saved me, thank you very much.<br><br>I serve the king with a variety of goblets, some of which are even magical!

e_sewers4_a_rp5=So the king was with you on the throne when you froze?
e_sewers4_a_rp5_s=(Ratman) "Yeah, I was serving him when the frost caught us. Hmm... I remember you, you were the first of us to study magic...<br><br>You should know that a few years after your exile, the king became greedy and less fearful of the elves. He opened the vault and with his closest advisers began collecting magical items and studying dark magic. Perhaps one of these items saved him from the cold.<br><br>As a fellow ratman, I'll give you 15% off my goblets."
e_sewers4_a_rp6=Know your place, you filthy rat! Just give them to me!
e_sewers4_a_rp6_s=Yogger's threats have an effect, and the ratman leaves the goblets on the ground and runs away.

e_sewers5_a_dsc=In the sewers, you find a large vault door in one wall. Surprisingly, the door is open and leads underground.<br><br>When you go down, the cold becomes unbearable. You take a quick look and see a large tunnel, along which you can see a lot of gold and shards. It seems that more objects were kept here, but now the vault is practically empty.<br><br>You go back up quickly so as not to freeze.

e_sewers8_a_nm=The king's dark deal
e_sewers8_a_dsc=You find yourselves in front of the king of the ratmen. With a gesture, he invites you to approach and says:<br><br>"I didn't expect to have visitors who didn't come from the well...

Maybe we could make a deal.<br><br>In exchange for the jewelry and some vitality of one of you, I'll use my corruption magic to upgrade their weapon. I'll also turn a blind eye and let you all through.

e_sewers8_a_rp2=No way am I making a deal with you! It's time to take revenge for everything you've done
e_sewers8_a_rp2_s=(King) "Mmm... I remember you... your name was Zek, right?

e_sewers8_a_rp3=I accept the deal. Take my jewelry and some of my vitality (-12 max HP)
e_sewers8_a_rp3_s=You hand your jewelry to the king of the ratmen and extend both arms, holding the weapon in one of them. The king grins wickedly and casts his spell.<br><br>Although you feel a little weaker because of the spell, your weapon glows a purple color and seems much more powerful.<br><br>Shortly after, the king points to the exit and leaves. You take advantage of his departure to search the surroundings, finding some gold and shards.
e_sewers8_a_rp4=I accept the deal. Take my jewelry, but I know you don't need my vitality for anything
e_sewers8_a_rp4_s=You hand your jewelry to the king of the ratmen and extend only one arm, holding the weapon in it. The king is somewhat angry that you know his wiles. But as he does not feel like fighting he proceeds with the deal and casts his spell.<br><br>Instantly, your weapon glows purple and seems much more powerful.<br><br>Shortly after, the king points to the exit and leaves. You take advantage of his departure to search the surroundings, finding some gold and shards.
e_sewers8_b_nm=The sewers are clean
e_sewers8_b_dsc=After a hard fight, you defeated the king of the ratmen and destroyed the scepter he used to control the dead.<br><br>You have cleared the sewers of the frozen dead, and the few remaining living ratmen have been able to escape.
e_sewers8_b_dsca=Now all that remains is to loot the king's corpse and find a way out quickly before you freeze to death.
e_sewers8_b_rp0=You search for valuable items on the king's body and in the surrounding area.
e_sewers8_b_rp0_s=The king was obsessed with jewelry, and you found several magic rings. One of them is the reason why he was not affected by the frost.<br><br>You also found some gold and magic shards in the surroundings.
e_sewers9_a_nm=Out of the well
e_sewers9_a_dsc=You find some stairs leading to the surface. They seem to belong to a well in the elven city.<br><br>The air entering the well is even colder than the air inside the sewers.<br><br>Before climbing outside, you take the opportunity to take a short break.
e_sewers9_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar28_c_dsca
e_sewers9_a_rp0=You rest a little before climbing the stairs.
e_sewers9_a_rp0_s=After regaining some strength, you climb the stairs of the well and appear in the middle of the frozen elven city.
e_wolf1_nm=The new captain
e_wolf1_dsc=The werewolves who decided to fight for the kingdom gathered at the watchtower near the forest.<br><br>There, a commander of the human army decided to form a special advance platoon, composed entirely of werewolves. Since we knew the terrain, it would be easier for us to advance through the forest.<br><br>After forming the platoon, he told us that he needed a captain, someone trustworthy and capable of leading us.
e_wolf1_dsca=(Commander) "Anyone volunteer to be captain?"
e_wolf1_rp0=It will be an honor to serve the kingdom and lead these comrades!
e_wolf1_rp0_s=(Commander) "You're Magnus, right? You've been serving with us for a while and I've heard good things about you, the position is yours."<br><br>(Yogger) "Is he going to be the Captain? He seems kind of weak... Well, we'll see, for now I'll follow him."
e_wolf1_rp1=These rascals need someone tough like me, I'll do it!
e_wolf1_rp1_s=(Commander) "I like your enthusiasm, but I don't think that calling your comrades rascals is the type of captain we are looking for...<br><br>You, over there! You're Magnus, right? You've been serving with us for a while, you'll be the captain."<br><br>(Magnus) "Thank you very much for your trust, I will do my best to deserve it."
e_wolf10_nm=The forest strikes back
e_wolf10_dsc=We cross the forest cutting the trees to make way for the main army.<br><br>When suddenly, two small treants appear and prevent us from advancing.<br><br>The treants are clearly angry and show a special hostility towards the sentinel who helped us cut the forest.
e_wolf10_dsca=rptd_e_aquar20_a_dsca
e_wolf10_rp0=There are few treants left... We should try to avoid them
e_wolf10_rp0_s=You try to avoid the treants, but the sentinel is very slow, and it is not possible to advance without leaving the sentinel behind.<br><br>(Magnus) "It's a shame, and I'd hate to cut them down, but I promised the Queen I'd return the sentinel to her when we're done with the mission. And so it shall be!".
e_wolf10_rp1=Let's not waste any more time! Let's use the cutting machine
e_wolf10_rp1_s=(Magnus) "We should avoid them... They're a species on the verge of extinction..."<br><br>(Yogger) "Captain, look at them! There's no way we can go forward without a fight. Go get 'em, boys!"
e_wolf12_nm=The thieves' camp
e_wolf12_dsc=Following the forest in an easterly direction, we arrive at a small camp.<br><br>There we find the group of thieves who have stolen the gem from Lord Hanshek. One of them, the youngest, sees us and approaches us saying:<br><br>(Thief) "Wolves... I don't know what you want from us, but this is our camp and we are not willing to abandon it.
e_wolf12_dsca=Say what you have come for and leave."
e_wolf12_rp0=We know you just stole a gem. We're here to get it back
e_wolf12_rp0_s=(Yogger) "Obviously, he's the one with the gem. Captain, why waste time, let's go get him!"<br><br>(Thief) "I didn't think they'd send someone so soon... especially with the war going on.<br><br>It seems that this gem is very important to that grumpy wizard... I'm not going to give it back!"
e_wolf12_rp1=Do not make me laugh! I'll take what I want from your dead body
e_wolf12_rp1_s=(Magnus) "Yogger, control yourself... Our mission is to recover the stolen gem and deliver it to Lord Hanshek. As soldiers of the kingdom, we must avoid killing them and bring them to justice."<br><br>(Thief) "I didn't think they'd send someone so soon... especially with the war going on.<br><br>It seems that this gem is very important to that grumpy wizard... I'm not going to give it back!"
e_wolf12b_nm=The stolen gem
e_wolf12b_dsc=During the combat, we wound several of the thieves and the rest manage to flee.<br><br>The youngest of them, slightly wounded, takes the gem out of a pocket and while he gives it to us he says:<br><br>(Andrin) "I am Andrin of the Casthak family, take the gem if that is what you want. But I warn you, Lord Hanshek is not to be trusted and he is up to no good.
e_wolf12b_dsca=Do what you must with me, but please don't give him the gem back."
e_wolf12b_rp0=We will return the gem to its owner, as is our duty. As for you...
e_wolf12b_rp0_s=(Yogger) "Captain, these thieves have committed a great offense to the kingdom! We should execute them in this very place, as Lord Hanshek would want..."<br><br>(Magnus) "No need. We have what we came for and the war continues.<br><br>As for you, Andrin... I met your brother in a tavern near the city. He is a good man and I would not like to give him a hard time. You're lucky we don't have time to go back and hand you over to justice. You can go. I hope this was just an unfortunate misunderstanding..."
e_wolf12b_rp1=Hand over the gem and prepare to be executed
e_wolf12b_rp1_s=(Magnus) "Not so fast Yogger... Now we abide by the rules of the kingdom. It is true that we don't have time to bring them back to justice... But we have the gem we came for and I will personally return it to Lord Hanshek.<br><br>So, Andrin, you are free to go. I met your brother in a tavern near the city. He is a good man and I would not like to give him a hard time. I hope this was just an unfortunate misunderstanding..."<br><br>(Yogger) "You're too soft, Captain! Lord Hanshek would want these thieves executed... When the time comes I'll make sure to report to him what you've done."
e_wolf13_nm=Ottis' revelation
e_wolf13_dsc=We reach the depths of the forest and there we see a humanoid doe blocking our path. As we approach, she tells us:<br><br>(Balina) "More werewolves... I am, Balina, protector of this forest and I won't let you pass. But this is strange... What does a pigman do next to these savages? Besides, you look like a healer... What are you doing on the front line of combat?"<br><br>(Ottis) "Oink... well... I don't know. I just wanted to help... Oink, it's true. This war and the front is not for me... I should meditate on this.
e_wolf13_dsca=Sorry guys, she's right and I can't face her... Oink... I can't go on like this, I have to go and reflect."
e_wolf13_rp0=Don't worry, my friend, you've done enough. Leave the rest to us
e_wolf13_rp0_s=(Yogger) "Really, Captain? Are you going to let him go just like that? He is a deserter and must be punished! When this war is over, I will personally take care of him.<br><br>(Balina) "You have made a wise decision, pigman.<br><br>As for the rest of you, I won't let you pass through this forest without a fight."
e_wolf13_rp1=Deserter! I won't forget this. When I'm done with this doe, I'll come for you!
e_wolf13_rp1_s=(Magnus) "Calm down Yogger... That's not the behavior of someone who wants to join the kingdom... You and I will have a talk later.<br><br>Please, Balina, let us pass. We are kingdom soldiers and we just want to get to Gorio's camp as soon as possible."<br><br>(Balina) "How do you want me to believe you after what that savage said... I'm sorry, but I'm not going to allow anyone to cross this forest and I'll fight to keep it that way."
e_wolf13b_nm=The protector falls
e_wolf13b_dsc=After defeating the dryads and wounding Balina, we explain to her that we really are soldiers of the kingdom.<br><br>Moreover, we manage to convince her that our only intention is to reach Gorio's camp. Then, she tells us:<br><br>(Balina) "Sorry for the misunderstanding, the werewolves we know are not to be trusted... My purpose is to protect this forest and clean it of werewolves.
e_wolf13b_dsca=I have someone very important who is waiting for me... If you let me go, I promise I will send you reinforcements from the forest to overthrow Gorio."
e_wolf13b_rp0=You can go. We never wanted to fight you. Also, I hope you keep your promise
e_wolf13b_rp0_s=(Yogger) "This is inadmissible, Captain! First you let the piggy desert... and now you intend to let this one go too? I'm sure she won't keep her promise... This time, I won't allow it!"<br><br>Yogger shouts his threat, distracting Magnus, and attacks. Yogger takes the opportunity to deliver the coup de grace with his axe to the already wounded Balina, who dies on the spot.<br><br>(Magnus) "What have you done! She had given up and offered us help! This is not the way we should behave... This was a big mistake. You disobeyed an order, and when the war is over we will have to report what happened."
e_wolf13b_rp1=It was your fault the piggy deserted! Don't expect us to take pity on you!
e_wolf13b_rp1_s=(Yogger) "I don't like you... Besides, you seem to really hate werewolves. The Captain is a softy and I'm sure he'll forgive you, like he did with the piggy. I'd better take care of you before that happens!"<br><br>Yogger shouts his threat, distracting Magnus, and attacks. Yogger takes the opportunity to deliver the coup de grace with his axe to the already wounded Balina, who dies on the spot.<br><br>(Magnus) "What have you done! She had given up and offered us help! This is not the way we should behave... This was a big mistake. You disobeyed an order, and when the war is over we will have to report what happened."
e_wolf14_nm=Two points of view
e_wolf14_dsc=The war continues, and we finally arrive near Gorio's camp.<br><br>The platoon has had disagreements about how we have acted in the various events that have brought us to this point in the war.<br><br>The tension is palpable and now is the perfect time to rest for a while before the fight with chieftain Gorio.
e_wolf14_dsca=As we rest, we wonder what everyone's opinion of Gorio is.
e_wolf14_rp0=Gorio is too stubborn, joining the kingdom is the best option for werewolves
e_wolf14_rp0_s=(Magnus) "Queen Amelia's proposal to unify all the races of the kingdom and be able to live in harmony is the best for everyone.<br><br>Even if I have to fight my own kind, I will do my best to make this unique opportunity come true."<br><br>(Yogger) "Captain, you've grown accustomed to life with humans and it's softened you up. You've been domesticated... Believe me, when this war is over, they won't thank you enough..."
e_wolf14_rp1=It's clear to me that werewolves are superior to others, in that sense Gorio is right.
e_wolf14_rp1_s=(Yogger) "We werewolves should be free and not have to ask permission to hunt in our forests. Humans want to turn us into their tame dogs... Well, they won't tame me!<br><br>But I think Gorio has made a big mistake in declaring open war on humans. The end of the war is near and it will not end until Gorio is overthrown."<br><br>(Magnus) "You seem to be clear that Gorio is our enemy and taking him down is the only option to end this war. Although sometimes I wonder if you didn't join the wrong side or what your real motives are..."
e_wolf15_nm=The Chieftain Gorio
e_wolf15_dsc=We make our way through the camp until we reach a large tent. There we are greeted by Gorio, who welcomes us saying:<br><br>(Gorio) "I've heard of you... The werewolf platoon that kills their own kind on the battlefield. Humans will tell you that you're brave... but in reality you are a disgrace to werewolves.<br><br>And you Yogger... seeing you on the side of the humans especially pains me. I had high hopes for you.
e_wolf15_dsca=Now I must execute you to set an example."
e_wolf15_rp0=You can still surrender peacefully! I am sure Queen Amelia will be merciful
e_wolf15_rp0_s=(Gorio) "You are the clear example of what I don't want to happen to my werewolves. More than a wolf, you are a domesticated dog! Surrendered at the feet of humans.<br><br>I'll be sure to nail your head to a pike to set an example for the others!"<br><br>(Magnus) "I'm sorry, but you're stuck in the past, Gorio. The only way to move forward and for there to be a future for werewolves is to coexist with the others. And for that reason, today, here and now, I'm going to put you down."
e_wolf15_rp1=You have led the werewolves well and I respect you for that. But now you must die
e_wolf15_rp1_s=(Gorio) "You say you respect me? Ha! don't make me laugh... So what is the fierce Yogger doing on the side of the humans if you agree with me?<br><br>Or is it that perhaps you were looking for a chance to take my place and were afraid to face me in a duel?"<br><br>(Yogger) "Me? Afraid of you? Don't be ridiculous... You've made a big mistake by provoking humans. Someone like you should have seen coming that we couldn't win in open warfare. I would have done better! What's more, when I'm done with you, maybe I will..."
e_wolf15b_nm=The Betrayal!
e_wolf15b_dsc=After a tough battle, we defeated the chieftain Gorio.<br><br>Magnus began to speak in celebration of victory and was about to ask the rest of the werewolves to surrender.<br><br>I, Yogger, couldn't allow him to continue talking and I threw a claw at his face to shut him up. Magnus was left wounded on the ground... I had to finish him off, but just at that moment the human army began to arrive.
e_wolf15b_dsca=This was my moment. If I made sure to finish Magnus off, I wouldn't be able to escape... So before running away, I shouted to the remaining werewolves.
e_wolf15b_rp0=Those of you who want to remain free, follow me!
e_wolf15b_rp0_s=Fleeing quickly was a good decision. In a moment, the human army occupied Gorio's camp, and as we fled I could see Magnus being tended to.<br><br>Most of Gorio's men followed me, and we headed into the depths of the northeast forest.
e_wolf16_nm=The End of the War
e_wolf16_dsc=With the werewolf chieftain defeated and his followers fleeing in disarray, the war ended shortly thereafter.<br><br>The humans decided to call this conflict the Wolf Wars. As Queen Amelia had promised, the humans gave shelter to all werewolves who wanted to join the kingdom.<br><br>Rumors reached Yogger that Magnus had been rewarded with nothing more than a medal of appreciation... Soon after, Magnus decided to leave the human army.
e_wolf16_dsca=Yogger's diary ends with recounting the following months on the run and little else.
e_wolf16_rp0=You stop reading and close the diary.
e_wolf16_rp0_s=You leave the diary where you found it and prepare to continue on your way.
e_wolf4_nm=The Queen's Steel Soldiers
e_wolf4_dsc=We arrive at the human outpost. Leading the army is Queen Amelia herself, along with a small group of extraordinary war machines.<br><br>Sentinels they call them, and just the sight of them made us all shudder. It is said that the Queen has built them based on dwarven models and that she now controls them thanks to her great magical power.<br><br>As we were about to leave, the Queen tells us:
e_wolf4_dsca=(Amelia) "Take one of these with you. They are a force to be reckoned with and will cut through anything."
e_wolf4_rp0=Your Majesty... Do we really need to cut down the forest?
e_wolf4_rp0_s=(Amelia) "I see you have a good heart, but we are at war... This is the fastest way for the army to advance and reach the enemy camp quickly. The forest will heal and grow again, count on it."<br><br>(Yogger) "As I suspected... you're a softie, Captain. The end justifies the means, now and always."
e_wolf4_rp1=Ohh, great... We can't say no to such a powerful killing machine!
e_wolf4_rp1_s=(Amelia) "Don't get too carried away. Although they are indeed extraordinary, it is my power that makes them work. When the war is over I will make sure to dismantle them all."<br><br>(Magnus) "My queen, I will take care to bring the sentinel back to you when we finish our task."
e_wolf5_nm=The Sleeping Treant
e_wolf5_dsc=We reach the interior of the forest, and in front of us stands the ancient obelisk of Senenthia.<br><br>As we approach, on one side of the obelisk, we see a group of dryads that seem to be protecting a large and old treant.<br><br>Fortunately, the treant is fast asleep and the dryads do not seem to have any intention of attacking us unless we approach it.
e_wolf5_dsca=Our men await orders on how to proceed.
e_wolf5_rp0=We must not disturb the forest dwellers, we will take a detour
e_wolf5_rp0_s=(Yogger) "Captain, but why? Don't be a coward, the big one is asleep, we can finish them off easily! Come on guys, let's get them!"<br><br>(Magnus) "No! Stop! That's an order! The kingdom does not seek unnecessary conflict and it is our duty as soldiers of the kingdom to keep it that way. We'll make a little detour."
e_wolf5_rp1=Chop-chop! Time to cut some wood, guys!
e_wolf5_rp1_s=(Magnus) "No! As new soldiers of the kingdom, our duty is to avoid conflict. We'll make a small detour, that's an order!"<br><br>(Yogger) "When you were assigned as captain, I already thought you were a coward... We will make a detour, but I guarantee you that in the future you will regret not having cut down that treant now that we had the chance."
e_wolf6_nm=The Field Hospital
e_wolf6_dsc=We arrive at a camp where several healers treat the wounded from the war.<br><br>One of them, a young pigman, approaches us and says:<br><br>(Ottis) "Oink... my name is Ottis and I have come to help heal the war wounded. I have already finished healing most of them... Oink... and I think I could be more useful at the front, healing on the spot.
e_wolf6_dsca=Oink... what do you say, may I join you?"
e_wolf6_rp0=Of course you can. I am Magnus, the captain of this platoon
e_wolf6_rp0_s=(Ottis) "Oink... Thank you very much Magnus. You seem like a nice guy. I'm sure I'll be useful to you, oink... I've trained a lot in protection and healing magic."<br><br>(Yogger) "Good thinking Captain, it's nice to have something for lunch nearby in a pinch."
e_wolf6_rp1=I think it's fine... We can always use him for lunch...
e_wolf6_rp1_s=(Ottis) "What!... Oink... I don't think I heard it right... You are soldiers of the kingdom right? Oink... I may have made a serious mistake..."<br><br>(Magnus) "Don't worry, he's joking... I am Magnus, the captain of this platoon. Rest assured, with me in command you will always be safe."
e_wolf8_nm=The Mysterious Excavation
e_wolf8_dsc=We arrive at an archaeological excavation behind the ancient Obelisk. It seems that something has happened. Everyone in the place is nervous. A wizard in ostentatious robes comes up to us and says:<br><br>(Hanshek) "You are just in time! We have just been robbed of something very important. The stolen object is an ancient gem... After months of digging... When I finally got it...<br><br>The thieves were human and headed east of the forest. It is vital that you recover it for me.
e_wolf8_dsca=I, Lord Hanshek, command you to retrieve the gem at any cost."
e_wolf8_rp0=Excuse me sir, but our orders are to reach Gorio's camp...
e_wolf8_rp0_s=(Hanshek) "I assume you are the captain of this platoon. I see you don't know who I am... Well, at least you have manners. I am Lord Hanshek, court magician and advisor to the king.<br><br>Therefore, as your superior, I order you to go immediately to retrieve the stolen gem. This order takes precedence over any other, and it is of vital importance that when you recover it you deliver it only to me and no one else."<br><br>(Yogger) "Captain, you should have asked for a reward... He's too interested in us returning it only to him. It seems a bit shady..."
e_wolf8_rp1=Of course, but with a good reward we would be more motivated...
e_wolf8_rp1_s=(Hanshek) "How insolent... Unlike Queen Amelia, I would expect nothing less from werewolves... I am Lord Hanshek, court magician and advisor to the king.<br><br>If you don't want to be executed for treason, you'd better hurry up and retrieve the stolen gem. Also, be sure to deliver it only to me and no one else."<br><br>(Magnus) "Yes, sir! I regret my comrade's comment. On my honor we will see to it that the gem is recovered immediately."
//////
e_sen46_a_dsc=As you leave the bandit camp Yogger hears a faint howl in the distance.<br><br>Yogger tells you to wait here for a moment.<br><br>After a while, a wolf cub appears from the nearby forest.
e_aquar43_a_nm=Binks the resource hunter
e_aquar43_a_dsc=You meet a werewolf resting near a ladder, when you get closer he says:<br><br>"Hello travelers, my name is Binks. My friend Charls and I founded a werewolf village far from here after serving in the Wolf Wars.<br><br>Now the village is well established and I travel in search of resources or items that can be used to improve our village.
e_aquar43_a_dsca=I'm willing to buy anything that might be useful to me that you don't need."
e_aquar43_a_rp0=You don't want to sell him anything.
e_aquar43_a_rp0_s=You say goodbye to him and continue on your way.
e_aquar43_a_rp1=Long time no see! How have you been?
e_aquar43_a_rp1_s=(Binks) "Hello Captain... What are you doing around here? Are you still playing the kingdom's lapdog, after how we were rewarded after the war?<br><br>With the meager reward they gave us, Charls and I decided to leave the kingdom and found our own village. If you want to stop by, you're welcome, Charls will be happy to see you.<br><br>Take these magical shards I found around here. Looks like we both have stuff to do, see ya."
e_aquar43_a_rp2=Hey buddy! Do you remember that I lent you money?
e_aquar43_a_rp2_s=(Binks) "Hi Yogger... yes, I do remember... Our newly founded village hit a rough patch... and we needed money for repairs.<br><br>Keep this gold, it's all I have with me. When I finish what I'm doing, I'll go to the village to get the rest..."<br><br>(Yogger) "You better not forget..."
e_aquar43_a_rp3=You offer him the old rope for 800g.

e_aquar43_b_rp2=Your friend owes me money... I hope he hasn't forgotten
e_aquar43_b_rp2_s=(Charls) "Yogger... I thought you'd be dead by now... I already told Binks not to do business with you...<br><br>Right now I don't have any money... but you can keep these magic shards. When I get back to the village I'll tell Binks to pay you the rest."<br><br>(Yogger) "I'll settle for now... but he better not forget."

e_voidhigh6_a_rp7=You remember the colors of the three scarabs you saw on one wall.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp7_s=You press the yellow, blue and green colors corresponding to the colors of the scarabs on the wall.<br><br>Suddenly, from the center of the magic circle appear those three scarabs, running all over the place and leaving behind them a trail of gold, shards and supplies. After a while they disappear, and somehow the sight of them running frantically makes you feel faster than before.<br><br>You pick up everything and leave the place.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp17=Basthet prepared me for this! She told me that one day I would triumph against the darkness!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp17_s=(Hanshek) "Basthet. Who could that be? You mean the so-called goddess of Ulminin?<br><br>And who do you think you are to confront me? A simple desert cat does not understand the greatness of what I have just achieved.<br><br>Thanks to the power of this gem, not even the gods will be able to oppose me!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp18=Thanks to the curse, I am here today. To fight and stop you!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp18_s=(Navalea) "Perhaps this was Basthet's intention all along... that I would be able to fight the Archons once again."<br><br>(Hanshek) "I don't know what you are talking about, but I see that you are one of them, an architect! <br><br>How is it possible that there are any of you still alive? Mmm... Wait a moment, it seems you are of no use to me. Your body and blood are not pure, they are corrupted... What a waste.<br><br>And you expect to stop me? Even if you are corrupted, I will dissect you to learn even more from your kind."
e_voidhigh14_a_nm=The Void bells
e_voidhigh14_a_dsc=You arrive at the ruins of an ancient battlefield, no doubt this is the place Laia told you about.<br><br>As you approach the center of the battlefield, you see the restless souls of the architects who fought in the war against the Archons as they escort you expectantly towards the center.
e_voidhigh14_a_dsca=To complete Basthet's trial, you must ring the silver bell given to you by Laia three times in the center of the battlefield.
e_voidhigh14_a_rp0=You ring the bell three times.
e_voidhigh14_a_rp0_s=When the third bell rings, the souls of the architects gathered around you bow before you in thanks and disappear.<br><br>You are proud to have helped these souls in sorrow and thus completed Basthet's trial.<br><br>Laia is now free to leave her post and travel out of the desert.
e_voidhigh15_a_nm=Cathedral of Light
e_voidhigh15_a_dsc=You arrive at the ruins of an ancient cathedral, after inspecting it for a while, this seems to be the sacred place where Navalea grew up.<br><br>Although the cathedral is practically destroyed, you see a halo of celestial light descending on a small altar that is still standing.
e_voidhigh15_a_dsca=The altar bathed in holy light seems the perfect place to purify the cursed badge of Navalea.
e_voidhigh15_a_rp0=You place the cursed badge on the altar.
e_voidhigh15_a_rp0_s=Shortly after placing the badge on the altar, you notice how the cursed energy it gives off dissipates. You decide to leave the badge on the altar as it seems to be its rightful place. <br><br>You feel good that you have honored your promise to Navalea. <br><br>Thanks to what you have done, now Navalea will regain her strength and will be able to leave her tomb.
e_pyr10_a_nm=The looted arsenal
e_pyr10_a_dsc=Thanks to the information given to you by the felines, you have found the secret arsenal inside the pyramid.<br><br>However, it is obvious that it has been thoroughly looted and that the felines have been taking their technological weapons out of here for centuries.
e_pyr10_a_dsca=Fortunately, it seems that they still have left some weapons for future generations.
e_pyr10_a_rp0=You search the armory to see if there is a weapon you can use.
e_pyr10_a_rp0_s=In addition to weapons, you also find some gold that you take with you.
e_pyr2_a_nm=Basthet's statue
e_pyr2_a_dsc=After walking down the long entrance hallway, you find yourselves in a large room where there is a statue of Basthet.<br><br>Around the statue you see a pile of gold. It seems that the felines make prayers to the statue and offer gold with them.<br><br>You notice that this room is well kept, but it seems that the felines do not go further into the corridors leading to the top of the pyramid.
e_pyr2_a_dsca=Do you want to make a prayer?
e_pyr2_a_rp0=You perform a normal prayer.
e_pyr2_a_rp0_s=The statue reacts with a small glow.<br><br>You can use the statue as an altar and upgrade your cards.
e_pyr2_a_rp1=You make a prayer offering 400g.
e_pyr2_a_rp1_s=The statue reacts to your prayer and glows.<br><br>You can use the statue as an altar and upgrade your cards at a discount.
e_pyr2_a_rp2=You try to steal some gold from the statue.
e_pyr2_a_rp2_s=You offer a fake prayer and manage to pick up some gold without anything happening.
e_pyr2_a_rp2_sc=You offer a fake prayer and manage to collect some gold without anything happening.<br><br>Curiously, the prayer works and besides picking up the gold, you can upgrade your cards.
e_pyr2_a_rp2_f=When you perform the prayer and are about to pick up the gold, you notice that something bad is about to happen.<br><br>Fortunately, you stop the prayer and decide not to pick up the gold in time.
e_pyr2_a_rp2_fc=As you perform the prayer and are about to pick up the gold, you notice that something bad is about to happen.<br><br>Unfortunately, you don't react in time, and a holy lightning bolt falls from the sky and hits you. You leave before more lightning strikes.
e_pyr2_a_rp3=Mother, I have come to see you... I need your help.
e_pyr2_a_rp3_s=You see Laia perform a prayer to the statue and suddenly a voice echoes throughout the room.<br><br>(Basthet) "Welcome back, my child, I knew you would come. As you must remember, the rules must be followed and only you are free to ascend the pyramid."<br><br>Laia frowns slightly, but after analyzing her mother's words, there is nothing to indicate that she has forbidden you to go ahead anyway.<br><br>Besides, the statue glows brightly and you can upgrade one card for free for each hero.
e_pyr2_a_rp4=I know you can hear me! I curse you for what you did to me!
e_pyr2_a_rp4_s=Navalea casts a curse on Basthet's statue.<br><br>Although she gets no response from Basthet, the statue becomes corrupted and you can use it to corrupt cards.
e_pyr3_a_nm=The ancient machine
e_pyr3_a_dsc=In the corner of the large corridor, you come across some kind of ancient machine.<br><br>After examining it for a while, it seems that the machine is intended to train the user's memory and coordination.<br><br>Although you are not quite sure... you deduce that playing the machine must give some kind of reward.
e_pyr3_a_dsca=Do you want to play a game?
e_pyr3_a_rp0=You don't want to try your luck...
e_pyr3_a_rp0_s=The machine also seems dangerous, so you prefer not to try your luck and leave.
e_pyr3_a_rp1=You are up for a game!
e_pyr3_a_rp1_s=Without thinking too much, you pull a lever and get ready to play the old machine.
e_pyr3_a_rp2=I have played this before. I'm going to lower the difficulty since I'm out of practice.
e_pyr3_a_rp2_s=Laia touches a few buttons before starting the game. It seems obvious that she grew up playing this machine.<br><br>Then she pulls a lever and the game starts.
e_pyr3_a_rp3=I've played this before. I'm going to up the difficulty to get better rewards!
e_pyr3_a_rp3_s=rptd_e_pyr3_a_rp2_s
e_pyr3_a_rp4=Interesting... so in the end she did build it.
e_pyr3_a_rp4_s=(Navalea) "A long time ago... I proposed to Basthet that building a machine like this would be a good idea to train future generations of paladins from a very young age.<br><br>It seems that after all, even after exiling me... she listened to me."<br><br>Navalea inspects the machine and pulls a lever. The game begins.
e_pyr3_6_nm=The ancient mural
e_pyr3_6_dsc=In the corner of the large corridor, you find a very ancient mural.<br><br>The mural is full of very old glyphs and most of them are unrecognizable to you. Even so, your general impression is that the mural depicts the origins of the pyramid.<br><br>Upon closer inspection, you realize that several of the glyphs can be moved and rotated. You have the feeling that some of them are misplaced.
e_pyr3_6_dsca=Do you want to try to reposition the glyphs?
e_pyr3_6_rp0=You think it's better not to move anything and you leave.
e_pyr3_6_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_pyr3_6_rp1=You try to reposition the glyphs to reread the mural.
e_pyr3_6_rp1_s=As you move the glyphs indiscriminately, you hear a voice echoing down the hall.<br><br>(Basthet) "Ignorance is not allowed here!"<br><br>Suddenly a holy bolt falls from the ceiling and hits you. You decide it's best to stop touching the glyphs and walk away hurt.
e_pyr3_6_rp2=You had a vision of this mural when you fainted in the desert!
e_pyr3_6_rp2_s=You move the glyphs to place them as you saw them in your vision.<br><br>Although you still do not understand the meaning of the mural, it seems obvious to you that they are now in the correct position.<br><br>As you place the last glyph correctly, a holy light descends from the ceiling and envelops you.
e_pyr3_6_rp3=I never understood this mural... but I know that it's better not to touch it.
e_pyr3_6_rp3_s=Laia tells you that when she was little, Basthet warned her not to touch the mural. Even so, when she grew a bit older and believed that Basthet would not see her... she made several attempts to move the glyphs to solve the mural.<br><br>All of them resulted in a punishment from Basthet and a warning that ignorance was not to her liking.<br><br>After hearing this, you decide that it is better not to touch the mural and you leave.
e_pyr3_6_rp4=Indeed, the glyphs are misplaced. This mural controls various systems of the pyramid.
e_pyr3_6_rp4_s=(Navalea) "One day, this pyramid appeared out of nowhere on the sands of Ulminin. A small expedition of architects, of which I was a part, were in charge of coming to investigate it.<br><br>After several months of trying to enter without success, Basthet chose me and let me in. Over time, she gave me to understand that she was not from this world and that the pyramid was what she used to move between worlds.<br><br>She never told me anything more about why she came and stayed. Maybe with more time... if she hadn't cursed me and locked me up... maybe she would have told me more."<br><br>After telling you the story, Navalea places the glyphs in their correct position, and a holy light descends from the ceiling and envelops her.
e_pyr7_a_nm=Basthet's Enigma
e_pyr7_a_dsc=I am Basthet, keeper of knowledge and observer of the past and all possible futures.<br><br>I was expecting you and I know why you have come, but before I offer you my help, you must answer my question correctly. Fail and you must endure my ordeal to regain my forgiveness.
e_pyr7_a_dsca=In the forest of Senenthia there is a gnome, an apprentice craftsman, who is still waiting for the return of his master.<br><br>What is the name of that gnome?
e_pyr7_a_rp0=Wilbur
e_pyr7_a_rp0_s=(Basthet) "You have answered incorrectly.<br><br>You must endure my ordeal and earn my forgiveness so that we can talk again."
e_pyr7_a_rp1=Timothy

e_pyr7_a_rp4_s=(Basthet) "Your sincerity honors you, but ignorance is not something to be proud of, much less something to be rewarded.<br><br>You have not answered me, therefore, you must endure my ordeal and earn my forgiveness so that we can talk again."
e_pyr7_a_rp5=Mother, we are in a hurry. We need your help!
e_pyr7_a_rp5_s=(Basthet) "My child, it seems that in a short time you have forgotten my teachings...<br><br>Rules come first! And you have failed to answer my question, no matter who you are or the rush you are in, there are no excuses or exceptions.<br><br>Therefore, you must endure my ordeal and earn my forgiveness so that we can talk again."
e_pyr7_a_rp6=You'll pay for what you did to me! I've hated you for so long...
e_pyr7_a_rp6_s=(Basthet) "My child, I can understand your hatred and your frustration... But thanks to what I did, you are here today, in this time.<br><br>Even if you don't understand it now... you are a key piece to save us all. Maybe it wasn't fair, but it was necessary to have the chance to save everyone's future.<br><br>Still, you have not answered the question, and as my first paladin you should know that the rules are unbreakable. Therefore, you must endure my ordeal and earn my forgiveness so we can talk again."

e_ulmin18_a_dsc=You find a pedestal with a strange orb on top that is anchored to the pedestal.

e_ulmin19_a_dsca=The story continues in the next tablet but it is broken and you would have to rebuild it to continue.

e_ulmin19_a_rp1_s=You manage to rebuild the tablet and continue reading.<br><br>A few years after punishing the paladin, the herons wondered if it was the right thing to do. In their point of view, she had done the right thing by fighting against the Archons... So the herons questioned Basthet and asked for mercy for the paladin. <br><br>Basthet did not answer them. Eventually the herons lost her favor and abandoned the oasis in the south of the desert.<br><br>After reading the history, you are impressed by the courage shown by the herons in questioning their benefactor.

e_ulmin19_a_rp1_fc=You do not manage to rebuild the tablet in such a way that the text remains readable. On top of that, you unintentionally break several pieces of the old tablet...<br><br>Seeing the mess, you leave the place demoralized.
e_ulmin20_a_nm=The Stone Door
e_ulmin20_a_dsc=As you make your way through the gorge, you come upon a spectacular stone door carved into the wall.<br><br>Upon entering, a large hidden blade swings down from the ceiling and almost reaches you.<br><br>You look down the long, dark corridor leading to the inner chambers and at the end of it you seem to see a small tile protruding from the wall. It looks to you like it might be a switch to stop the blade trap.
e_ulmin20_a_dsca=Entering seems too dangerous and the switch is quite far away.
e_ulmin20_a_rp0=You don't want to take the risk and you leave.

e_ulmin20_a_rp2=You try to run to the other side quickly avoiding the blades.
e_ulmin20_a_rp2_s=You run as fast as you can and reach the other side unharmed.
e_ulmin20_a_rp2_f=You run as fast as you can, but unfortunately one of the hidden blades hits you causing an open wound, <br><br>You use your remaining strength and reach the other side.
e_ulmin20_a_rp3=I will shoot an arrow to activate the switch!
e_ulmin20_a_rp3_s=Your aim is excellent and you hit the target on the first try. As you thought that tile was a switch and the blade trap stops.<br><br>With the trap stopped, you all pass to the other side.
e_ulmin20_a_rp3_f=You miss on your first attempt and get a little closer to try again.  One of the hidden blades hits you, causing an open wound, but now that you are closer you try again and hit the target.<br><br>As you thought, that tile was a switch and the blade trap stops.<br><br>With the trap stopped, you all pass to the other side.

e_ulmin21_a_nm=The abandoned camp
e_ulmin21_a_dsc=You arrive at a camp on the edge of the gorge.<br><br>From here, you can see the spectacular stone door carved into the wall of the gorge. In order to go there, you would need a rope to descend the gorge.<br><br>It seems that this camp belonged to the felines and they abandoned it some time ago to go to the more fertile lands of the southern oasis.
e_ulmin21_a_dsca=This may be a good time to regain your strength.

e_ulmin21_a_rp3=You are fine. You take the opportunity to search the surroundings.
e_ulmin21_a_rp3_s=You find some gold and some notes from the felines that read:<br><br>"After sending several expeditions to meet the djinn, we have observed that when he grants you a wish it is better not to respond. <br><br>One expedition obtained a positive result by suggesting to him that he was not powerful enough to corrupt our jewelry.

e_ulmin27_a_dsc=You see a group of herons taking sand from inside a pyramid. When you get closer, one of them tells you:<br><br>"Welcome and let me tell you something about us. Many generations ago, our ancestors made a big mistake in these pyramids. After several decades, they regretted it, but it was too late... To do penance, it is now our duty to protect and keep taking care of these pyramids.<br><br>By the way, a few days ago, the ancient Obelisk was activated and shook the desert. The entrance to the catacombs is blocked by sand and we are currently removing it.
e_ulmin27_a_dsca=Is there anything we can do for you?"
e_ulmin27_a_rp0=Can we rest here for a while before leaving?
e_ulmin27_a_rp0_s=The herons give you their approval, and you rest for a while to regain your strength.<br><br>Shortly after, you thank them and leave.
e_ulmin27_a_rp1=Surely you have something from the pyramids that you can sell us...
e_ulmin27_a_rp1_s=You manage to convince him, and the heron agrees to sell you items from the pyramid.

e_ulmin27_a_rp1_fc=Not only did we not get him to sell you anything, but you also managed to offend him.<br><br>They kick you out and you leave disappointed.
e_ulmin27_a_rp2=We are the ones who filled the eastern oasis with healing water.
e_ulmin27_a_rp2_s=It seems that the news of what you did came before you.<br><br>He thanks you again and offers you the chance to buy various items taken from inside the pyramids with a small discount.

e_ulmin27_a_rp4_s=The herons can't believe their eyes when they see Navalea. Stunned and surprised, the herons gather around her and prostrate themselves before her.<br><br>Navalea repeats that she forgives them, that they have done enough penance since it was not their fault. Their ancestors only followed Basthet's orders and could have done little else.<br><br>While you rest, one of the herons tells Navalea that they have left a hidden trail in the sand that comes out of the top of the Obelisk.

e_ulmin30_a_dsc=You see a feline standing guard in front of a pyramid. When you approach she says:<br><br>"Hello adventurers, I am Laia, the paladin of the omniscient Basthet. She foretold that you would come and prophesied that one day I would join a group of adventurers like you. But first, that group had to prove itself and pass a trial.<br><br>Right now I cannot accompany you on the trial.  For my duty is to guard the entrance to the tomb of the previous paladins.

e_ulmin30_a_dsca=Do you want to try to pass Basthet's trial?".
e_ulmin30_a_rp0=We accept the trial, and we will prove that we are worthy-
e_ulmin30_a_rp0_s=(Laia) "I had a feeling you would accept. You see, Basthet told me to give you this little silver bell. The trial is for you to ring the bell three times on one of the ancient battlefields where the war against the Archons was fought. In doing so you will purify the souls of the dead, and Basthet will be pleased.<br><br>I don't know exactly where you have to go, but if Basthet entrusts you with this test it is because she knows you will find the place. I hope you complete the trial and that Basthet will give me permission to travel beyond this desert with you."
e_ulmin30_a_rp1=We accept the trial, besides we are honorable and want to enter the tomb.

e_ulmin30_b_nm=The unguarded tomb
e_ulmin30_b_dsc=You arrive at a pyramid and the entrance to the catacombs is open.

e_ulmin31_a_dsc=You are in front of the great pyramid of Ulminin. No one knows when or how it was built, but looking at its massive and complex structure one might think it is from another world.<br><br>The entrance to the interior of the pyramid is clear and there seem to be no guards nearby.<br><br>When you try to enter you run into a faint force field that pulls you back, but not enough to stop you from getting through if you wish.
e_ulmin31_a_dsca=To enter the pyramid you will have to withstand the force field and pass through it.
e_ulmin31_a_rp0=You try to withstand the force field and break through it.
e_ulmin31_a_rp0_s=The force field is weaker than expected and does not affect you at all.
e_ulmin31_a_rp0_f=You manage to get through the force field but somehow you feel weird and kind of sanctified.
e_ulmin31_a_rp1=Don't worry, I know how to deactivate it.
e_ulmin31_a_rp1_s=Laia puts her hand on a tile near the door and the force field is deactivated.<br><br>You enter the pyramid.
e_ulmin31_a_rp2=These cheap tricks won't stop me!
e_ulmin31_a_rp2_s=Navalea hits the force field with her hate-filled fists and it shatters.<br><br>You enter the pyramid.
e_ulmin35_a_nm=The obelisk top
e_ulmin35_a_dsc=You reach the Ulminin Obelisk, but because of the sand you are too high.<br><br>Although you can see the Glyph, the runes that would allow you to advance are still many meters below you.<br><br>You try to make your way through the sand, but after removing a thin layer of sand, it solidifies. You get the impression that there is a chamber under the sand.
e_ulmin35_a_dsca=There is nothing else you can do here, now you have to find a way to access the lower chambers to read the runes on the obelisk.
e_ulmin35_a_rp0=You decide that it is better not to waste any more time
e_ulmin35_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_ulmin35_a_rp1=You try to look for magic shards around.

e_ulmin35_a_rp2=Follow the hidden trail left by the herons.
e_ulmin35_a_rp2_s=You find the heron trail and follow it for a while as you move away from the obelisk.<br><br>Little by little, you notice how the sand is more unstable... there is no turning back now.
e_ulmin36_a_nm=The quicksand
e_ulmin36_a_dsc=Little by little, the quicksand pushes you down.<br><br>Maybe the herons tricked you? Maybe they betrayed Navalea again, after all?<br><br>There is no time for such questions, as you are about to be engulfed by the sand.
e_ulmin36_a_dsca=All you can do now is take a deep breath and trust...
e_ulmin36_a_rp0=You take a deep breath and close your eyes.
e_ulmin36_a_rp0_s=You are engulfed by the sand, but quickly fall to a lower floor.<br><br>You open your eyes and see that the herons did not deceive you after all. You find yourselves in an ancient chamber of the lower catacombs.
e_ulmin37_a_nm=The Djinn
e_ulmin37_a_dsc=In the desert, you come across a mysterious dusty lamp. The lamp seems to have something written on it, but you can't see it because of the accumulated dust.<br><br>When you rub the lamp, a smiling Djinn suddenly appears out of it. He greets you saying:<br><br>"Thank you very much travelers! It's been a long time since I've seen anyone or breathed fresh air, hahaha... I guess, as is the old custom, I should grant you three wishes. Since there are four of you, I'll grant you one wish that works for all of you."
e_ulmin37_a_dsca=What wish would you like to make?
e_ulmin37_a_rp0=The felines recommended that it is better not to answer him.
e_ulmin37_a_rp0_s=You politely tell him that you don't want anything and leave.<br><br>The Djinn seems disappointed and as you walk away you see him go back into the lamp.
e_ulmin37_a_rp1=You had a vision of the Djinn laughing at you, so you ask for nothing.
e_ulmin37_a_rp1_s=rptd_e_ulmin37_a_rp0_s

e_ulmin37_a_rp3_s=The djinn stops laughing and says to you:<br><br>"So you are the ambitious smart-ass type... You should know that I am under no obligation to grant you a wish. In fact, I hate those who think they are smarter than anyone else... You should suffer my wrath!".<br><br>The Djiin gives you a terrifying look that leaves you frightened. Then he gets into the lamp and the lamp disappears.
e_ulmin37_a_rp4=We wish for mountains of gold, we want to be rich!
e_ulmin37_a_rp4_s=The Djiin keeps laughing and says:<br><br>"Hahaha... a classic! Greedy people like you should learn a lesson".<br><br>The Djiin casts a spell and with it steals some gold from you. Then he gets into the lamp and the lamp disappears.
e_ulmin37_a_rp5=We wish for power... absolute power!
e_ulmin37_a_rp5_s=The Djiin keeps laughing and says:<br><br>"Hahaha... a classic! Why should I share my power with wimps like you? Your body is not ready, I'll prove it to you".<br><br>The Djinn casts a spell and you feel the power coursing through your body, but suddenly something goes wrong, and you feel a couple of bones break. The Djin laughs and stops casting the spell. Then he gets into the lamp and the lamp disappears.
e_ulmin37_a_rp6=We wish for your freedom!
e_ulmin37_a_rp6_s=The Djinn keeps laughing and says:<br><br>"Ohh... Amazing! So you're the type to go around playing hero. But what makes you think I'm not free? A bit presumptuous of you, isn't it?"<br><br>The Djinn says no more and goes back into the lamp.<br><br>You leave the place rather disappointed.
e_ulmin37_a_rp7=Are you really that powerful? I bet you're not capable of corrupting my jewelry.
e_ulmin37_a_rp7_s=The Djinn frowns and says:<br><br>"Looks like the felines are going around telling my secrets... It's time for me to move somewhere else. But first, you will see that I am indeed powerful and I will corrupt your jewelry."<br><br>The Djinn casts a spell and corrupts your jewelry. Then he gets into the lamp and the lamp disappears.
e_ulmin38_a_nm=The Sandworm
e_ulmin38_a_dsc=When you realize you are inside a huge sand pit that slowly engulfs you towards the center.<br><br>Suddenly, a large sandworm appears from inside the pit. The worm opens its big toothy mouth and waits for the sand to drag you towards it.
e_ulmin38_a_dsca=It seems inevitable that you will have to defeat it if you don't want to be devoured.
e_ulmin38_a_rp0=You prepare for combat.
e_ulmin38_a_rp0_s=As the sand slowly drags you towards the center, you get ready for combat, you catch your breath and regain some strength.<br><br>You reach the center and the fight begins.
e_ulmin38_a_rp1=The felines warned you about the sandworm and you prepared yourself accordingly.
e_ulmin38_a_rp1_s=Fortunately, thanks to the felines' information, you learned of the existence of the sandworm. You rested for a while and prepared for combat before entering the sand pit.
e_ulmin38_b_nm=Falling down the sand pit
e_ulmin38_b_dsc=After a fierce fight you kill the sandworm and just at that moment the sand pit starts to collapse.<br><br>It seems that the sandworm was acting as a stopper and now all the sand, and you with it, falls underground.
e_ulmin38_b_dsca=You can only close your eyes and hope to fall somewhere safe without being buried by the sand.
e_ulmin38_b_rp0=You open your eyes and see what happened.
e_ulmin38_b_rp0_s=You are in the lower catacombs and have narrowly escaped death. A few meters from where you landed, there is a bottomless pit where the sand worm fell in along with all the sand above.<br><br>You quickly inspect the chamber where you are and pick up some gold and supplies that you find. Fearful of all the sand falling from the ceiling, you decide to leave quickly.

e_ulmin43_a_nm=The forgotten one
e_ulmin43_a_dsc=In a burial chamber you find a woman on the floor, leaning against an open sarcophagus. She seems very weak, when you come to help her she whispers:<br><br>"How many centuries has it been... A few days ago, I noticed the energy of an Obelisk activating; that woke me up and broke the seal of the sarcophagus.<br><br>Sorry strangers, I'm still very weak... I feel that the curse that falls on me is still active. Although it has somehow kept me alive all this time, the curse drains my strength.
e_ulmin43_a_dsca=Maybe you could help me to get rid of the curse?"
e_ulmin43_a_rp0=What can we do to help you?
e_ulmin43_a_rp0_s=(Navalea) "Thank you very much strangers, I am Navalea by the way. It's a long story, but I was cursed and locked in this sarcophagus unjustly a long time ago.<br><br>In order to lift the curse, you must first find its source. It is probably an ancient object that belonged to me long ago... now that I remember, before I was locked up, my family badge was taken away from me. I feel it must be nearby, east of here.<br><br>Once you have the source of the curse, you must purify it. In the old days there was a sacred cathedral in my homeland where you could do it... but I don't know if it still exists after the war and after so much time."
e_ulmin43_a_rp1=It seems complicated and we don't have time for that.
e_ulmin43_a_rp1_s=You tell her you're sorry but you can't help her, then you leave.
e_ulmin43_a_rp2=I won't help you, moreover... how the hell are you still alive?
e_ulmin43_a_rp2_s=(Laia) "I don't understand... Basthet should know about this, yet she didn't warn me?<br><br>I guess she doesn't care about you anymore... or are you alive because of her? I don't know... what is clear to me is that I won't help someone who betrayed her. <br><br>You're lucky we're in a hurry or I'd put you back in that sarcophagus myself."
e_ulmin43_b_nm=The burial chamber
e_ulmin43_b_dsc=You find a burial chamber with an open sarcophagus, when you go to inspect it, Navalea says:<br><br>"This is where I was unjustly imprisoned for centuries....<br><br>When I woke up, I didn't have time to worry about those things, but now that I look at it, the chamber is well maintained.
e_ulmin43_b_dsca=Besides, whoever kept the chamber seems to have left some gold and magic shards in my honor."
e_ulmin43_b_rp0=You pick up the gold and magic shards.
e_ulmin43_b_rp0_s=You pick up all the gold and magic shards you can find and leave the chamber.
e_ulmin44_a_nm=The embedded Scarabs
e_ulmin44_a_dsc=You come to a large dark chamber and on one of its walls you see something glowing.<br><br>As you get closer you see that what glows are three small decorative scarabs embedded in the wall. The three scarabs are different and one is made of gold, the other of sapphire and the third of jade. They look very valuable... <br><br>You try to pry one off the wall, but it is well embedded. If you really want one of them, you'll have to break the wall a bit to get it out.
e_ulmin44_a_dsca=Which scarab do you want to get?
e_ulmin44_a_rp0=You prefer to leave and not break any wall.
e_ulmin44_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_ulmin44_a_rp1=You try to break the wall to get the gold scarab.
e_ulmin44_a_rp1_s=As you start to break through part of the wall you hear a continuous and creepy noise. Suddenly you realize that many black scarabs start to come out from everywhere and in a moment they surround you.<br><br>You have to abandon the idea of grabbing the decorative scarab and get out of there quickly. Fighting your way through the swarm of black scarabs.

e_ulmin45_a_nm=The builder's name
e_ulmin45_a_dsc=You reach a large chamber with tiles on the floor; on each tile is engraved a different letter.<br><br>You carefully step on one of the tiles and suddenly a poisoned arrow comes out of a hole in the wall and crosses the entire chamber. You dodge the arrow by sheer luck.<br><br>You notice that on the side of the room there is a small tablet that seems to refer to the builder of this chamber, but her name does not appear.
e_ulmin45_a_dsca=You suspect that to pass unharmed you have to step on the tiles that correspond to the builder's name.
e_ulmin45_a_rp0=You try to get to the other side while dodging the poisoned arrows.
e_ulmin45_a_rp0_s=You manage to get to the other side dodging all the poisoned arrows.
e_ulmin45_a_rp0_f=You manage to get to the other side but unfortunately you have been hit by one of the arrows and have been poisoned.
e_ulmin45_a_rp1=The felines mentioned that the name of the builder was Galatea.
e_ulmin45_a_rp1_s=The felines were right, and you cross the chamber without problems stepping on the tiles with the letters that form Galatea's name.
e_ulmin45_a_rp2=Her name was Galatea and she was a friend of mine.
e_ulmin45_a_rp2_s=Navalea tells you that she came to the Ulminin desert a long time ago with a group of architects and that Galatea was one of them.<br><br>Stepping on the right tiles you manage to pass to the other side without problems.
e_ulmin45_a_rp3=Let me guess the correct tiles based on their wear.
e_ulmin45_a_rp3_s=You go first and manage to step on the right tiles, reaching the other side without any problems.<br><br>The rest of the group follows in your footsteps.
e_ulmin45_a_rp3_f=You go first and manage to step on the right tiles, unfortunately when you get almost to the end you make a mistake and an arrow hits you, poisoning you.<br><br>The rest of the group follows your steps and learns from your mistake, reaching the other side safely.

e_ulmin50_a_dsc=In a chamber, you come across an ancient mural that reads:<br><br>"A long time ago, a group of architects came to Ulminin to inspect the great pyramid that one day appeared out of nowhere. The pyramid remained closed for a while, until it opened for one of them. That is how the chosen one met Basthet.<br><br>Eventually the architects built monuments in the desert, along with the Obelisk. Meanwhile, the chosen one swore an oath of loyalty to Basthet, becoming her first paladin.<br><br>A short time later, a great war began in the architects' homeland.

e_ulmin50_a_rp0=You see Navalea's badge embedded in the mural, radiating cursed energy.
e_ulmin50_a_rp0_s=You notice that on one side of the mural is embedded the family badge of Navalea. It radiates cursed energy and clearly this is the source of the curse.<br><br>You pick up the badge, and as she told you, now you will have to find a way to purify it. According to the mural and what she told you, the best way would be to look somewhere in her homeland.
e_ulmin50_a_rp1=You try to search for gold and shards in this chamber.

e_ulmin52_a_rp0=You take the white chest.

From what Laia has told you, the sarcophagi belong to the previous paladins of Basthet.<br><br>You try to open one of the sarcophagi but they are hermetically sealed and they seem to have some magic that seals them even more.

e_ulmin56_a_nm=Hall of the dead
e_ulmin56_a_dsc=You reach a hall full of undead and at the end of which you see the obelisk of Ulminin.<br><br>You notice that in the middle of the hall there is an ancient sarcophagus and around it there is a kind of lich that seems to have been resurrected with the corrupted energy from the activation of the obelisk.<br><br>No doubt the lich is the reason why all the chambers are infested with undead and there is no way to reach the obelisk without defeating it.
e_ulmin56_a_dsca=How do you want to approach combat?
e_ulmin56_a_rp0=Without wasting any time, you charge at it.
e_ulmin56_a_rp0_s=You take the lich by surprise and the fight begins.

e_ulmin56_a_rp1_fc=You fail to hide and the lich sees you. <br><br>The lich makes a terrifying scream that leaves you frightened and the lich prepares for combat.
e_ulmin56_a_rp2=I knew him... he shouldn't have ended up like that!
e_ulmin56_a_rp2_s=Navalea gets angry and hits the ground several times with her gloves, returning the darkness that looms over you to the undead.<br><br>She then charges bursting with power at the lich and the combat begins.
e_ulmin56_a_rp3=I will pray to Basthet for our victory.
e_ulmin56_a_rp3_s=It seems that Basthet answers Laia's prayer, and a glowing light purges the darkness that looms over you.<br><br>With Basthet's blessing, the combat begins.

e_ulmin8_a_rp4=You pay 300g and ask for information about the eastern desert.
e_ulmin8_a_rp4_s=(Feline) "There are several things you should know if you go east. Beware of the sand pit, there is a large sand worm there and you better be prepared to protect yourself from the sand. Also in the desert dwells a djinn who likes to tease travelers and play bad pranks. The best thing to do is to refuse his offer and leave.<br><br>Ahhh, I forgot... we also have a small store over there, we'll tell them you're going and you'll get a small discount."<br><br>You thank him and leave.

e_sen4_b1_rp3=We are in a hurry, but I will send several soldiers to help you.
e_sen4_b1_rp3_s=Amelia promises the farmers that she will send a delegation of soldiers from the castle to help them rebuild their homes.<br><br>The farmers thank the queen for her help and give you some magic shards they found while tilling the fields and an old rope.
e_sen5_a_rp7=I understand how you feel. We will find your son.
e_sen5_a_rp7_s=The baker bows to the queen and thanks her for her help.<br><br>He gives you the gold and also tells you to take whatever you want from an old chest next to the mill.
e_sen17_b_rp4=Time has not been kind to you, old friend. I will help you.
e_sen17_b_rp4_s=(Cornelius) "Ohh... you're Amelia right? I remember I asked you for another favor some time ago... but now I don't know what it was.<br><br>The truth is that right now what I need most is my old staff. You'll find it Velkarath in my old place. I'm sure you remember where it was. Take these shards, and thank you very much Amelia."<br><br>(Amelia) "I will bring you your staff as soon as possible, my friend. And as for the other favor... don't worry, everything is fine now".
e_sen20_b_rp4=I built this golem... I didn't think I'd ever see one of these again.
e_sen20_b_rp4_s=(Amelia) "Even when I ordered it to be dismantled, we could use its help. Unfortunately, right now my powers are too unstable to make it work... maybe if we find something similar to its original source we could reactivate it.<br><br>The black forge is sealed... but perhaps in its surroundings we can obtain a core that we can use to activate it."<br><br>As you hide the golem so that it does not suffer any more damage, you find a few magic shards.
e_sen27_a_rp5=I have allowed your misdeeds for a long time... this ends today!
e_sen27_a_rp5_s=(Yogger) "The queen herself deigns to come for me, what an honor! Still, what are you doing wasting your time here... shouldn't you be somewhere else?<br><br>I heard that your own advisor has betrayed you and kidnapped your daughter. The truth is that I'm not at all surprised by that scoundrel... Well, enough of the chatter, if I finish you off today, the kingdom will easily fall into my hands!"<br><br>Although Yogger played tough with the queen... the truth is that he is quite afraid of having to face her.

e_voidlow21_a_rp8=This book is magnificent. I'm going to keep it!
e_voidlow21_a_rp8_s=Amelia has found a very interesting book that may be useful to her and decides to keep it.<br><br>It's time to move on.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp19=Where is my daughter! How could you Hanshek... You will pay for this!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp19_s=(Hanshek) "Dear Amelia, the princess is well, and thanks to her I have been able to realize my dream!<br><br>After finding this ancient jewel in the Wolf Wars, I spent years researching and experimenting with it. Unfortunately, by the time I discovered that the key to the jewel's power was the magical blood of a descendant of the architects, you had already gone into exile... Partly because of me, since it was my experiments with the jewel that destabilized your powers.<br><br>I thought all was lost... but as the princess's 16th birthday approached, she showed signs of possessing the same ancient magic as you. So I waited for the right moment and now thanks to her blood and this jewel, my power is unlimited!"

e_aquar9_a_rp4_s=You cut some wood from the nearby trees and give it to Nenukil. With it and the remains of the broken boat, he builds a new boat in a moment.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.

e_forge3_a_rp5_s=Nenukil picks up the obsidian and starts working at the forge, almost without looking at the plans.<br><br>After a while he has built all the artifacts, using up the obsidian.
e_forge5_a_rp4=This is a dwarven trap box. But I know how to open it!
e_forge5_a_rp4_s=Nenukil opens the box without complications. Inside the box, he finds a small mysterious key with a black ribbon.<br><br>When he passes near the statues, they are activated. Nenukil was overconfident and at no time thought that those ash-covered golems could still be active...<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge8_a_rp11=Ohh! I never thought I would meet a fellow dwarf in the forge.
e_forge8_a_rp11_s=The other dwarf is surprised to see Nenukil and they both burst out laughing.<br><br>After a while of sitting near the lava telling old stories, the dwarf shares one of his carp with Nenukil. While they talk, you find a few magic shards in the surrounding area.<br><br>It is time to leave and you say goodbye to the dwarf.
e_forge6_a_rp5=After all these years... how has this thing still not melted down?
e_forge6_a_rp5_s=Amelia tells you how, many years ago, she faced this machine piloted by the general of the dwarves... Unfortunately, something went wrong, and they had to flee.<br><br>She hoped that after sealing the Black Forge and with the recent volcano activity, it along with the other dwarven machines would have melted.<br><br>Amelia casts a spell to protect you from the heat and you face the machine.
e_forge6_a_rp6=It seems my creation has come back to haunt me... once again
e_forge6_a_rp6_s=Nenukil tells you that he was the one who designed and built this machine for the general of the dwarves, a long time ago.<br><br>Luckily for you, the old machine is quite damaged and Nenukil knows all its weaknesses.

e_faen16_a_rp6=If necessary, I could learn it and sing with the elf...
e_faen16_a_rp6_s=The elf refuses to teach his ancient song to a dwarf like Nenukil.<br><br>Still, since he has shown interest in helping, he gives you a few magic shards as thanks and asks you to leave.

I feel like I could cure you...<br><br>I'm very sorry, great protector of the forest, but I have to find my daughter as soon as possible and make Hanshek pay for it, so I have no choice..."<br><br>Amelia casts a quick spell that weakens Ylmer and the dryads. The fight begins.
e_aquar18_a_rp9=I can try to sing a dwarven song...
e_aquar18_a_rp9_s=Nenukil sings a lullaby from his childhood and tries to match it with the soft tone emanating from the altar.<br><br>Surprisingly, it works. The altar is brimming with energy and offers you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade one card for free for each hero.
e_aquar18_a_rp9_f=Nenukil sings a tavern song and does not worry at all about trying to make it resemble the soft tone emanating from the altar.<br><br>The altar loses what little energy it had left, and the infuriated sirens come out of the water and attack you.
e_velka25_a_rp5=You have destroyed his legacy in Velkarath. You are a disgrace to your master!
e_velka25_a_rp5_s=(Erekhal) "No, he abandoned us! Now the burning hand is mine, and even if you are the queen of Senenthia you will not take from me what I have rebuilt!"<br><br>(Amelia) "You are still an ungrateful child... you still don't see all that he sacrificed to save Velkarath? I am in a hurry and you leave me no choice, so I will put an end to this cult of yours once and for all!"<br><br>After seeing Amelia's determination, several of Erekhal's followers flee from the combat.
e_velka25_b_rp2=You are a disgrace to your master... give me his staff right now!
e_velka25_b_rp2_s=(Erekhal) "No, he abandoned us!

I am in a hurry and you leave me no choice, so I will take it from you by force if I have to."<br><br>After seeing Amelia's determination, several of Erekhal's followers flee from the combat.

e_velka41_a_nm=The time rift
e_velka41_a_dsc=On the slope of the volcano you see a flickering glow that catches your attention. As you approach, a large eldritch rift forms before you.<br><br>You stand on guard, but no horror comes out of it, and you realize that this rift is unlike any you have seen before.<br><br>It is larger, and the energy that emanates from it is completely different from the other rifts. You look through it, and it does not seem to lead to another place... but to the same place you are in, however, different...
e_velka41_a_dsca=Do you want to cross the rift?
e_velka41_a_rp0=You dare to venture into the unknown.
e_velka41_a_rp0_s=Showing off your adventurous spirit, you cross the rift without hesitation.<br><br>When you get to the other side, you quickly realize that you are surely in the same place. However, there is less ash and the volcano seems to be less active.<br><br>A little dizzy, you look around and see a tunnel on the side of the volcano, a small camp, soldiers, and suddenly... Your eyes close and you briefly lose consciousness.
e_velka41_a_rp1=As it seems dangerous, you prefer not to cross the rift.
e_velka41_a_rp1_s=You think it is too risky to enter an unknown rift that suddenly appeared.<br><br>You leave the place and leave the rift behind.
e_uprising1_a_nm=The backup group
e_uprising1_a_dsc=Crossing the rift was a harder toll than you thought, but you quickly regain consciousness.<br><br>When you open your eyes, you see that a soldier from the nearby camp approaches you and says:<br><br>"You must be the backup group! Perfect, the vanguard has already entered the volcano, led by the king's advisor Amelia and Chancellor Cornelius of the Burning Hand.
e_uprising1_a_dsca=You must not waste any more time. You must enter through the tunnel and reach them to help them quell the Obsidian Uprising."
e_uprising1_a_rp0=The Obsidian Uprising? What's going on here?
e_uprising1_a_rp0_s=(Soldier) "You know... the dwarves have begun a conquest of Velkarath, they are building war machines with obsidian from the volcano and a new energy source. We have come here to stop them... aren't you here for that?"<br><br>The soldier looks at you confused and you, after hearing that, look around and realize that the rift has taken you to the past, specifically to the Velkarath of 30 years ago.<br><br>Although you are somewhat stunned by this fact, you agree to enter the tunnel towards the volcano, before more soldiers arrive and you attract more attention.
e_uprising1_a_rp1=I have the feeling I know what happened...
e_uprising1_a_rp1_s=Amelia hides behind the group so that the soldiers won't recognize her and urges the group to accept. When you are alone and enter the tunnel she says:<br><br>(Amelia) "The rift we crossed must have been a time rift and, it has sent us back in time, specifically 30 years ago. We have to find another time rift so we can return to our time.<br><br>I remember this tunnel... together with Cornelius, Nenukil, Wilbur and a small group of soldiers, we entered the volcano to quell the uprising. In the end, after several unforeseen events, we defeated the dwarf generals and managed to escape from the volcano.<br><br>Chasing myself seems weird... I hope everything goes well..."
e_uprising1_a_rp2=What are you talking about? The uprising was 30 years ago...
e_uprising1_a_rp2_s=(Soldier) "Stop, what's a dwarf doing here? Although you look a lot like the dwarf who was with advisor Amelia... Maybe you're a relative and have also come to help?"<br><br>After hearing that, Nenukil, stunned, takes a good look at his surroundings and realizes... The rift has taken him back in time, specifically 30 years ago, when Nenukil helped Amelia quell the uprising of his people. Nenukil's face pales little by little just thinking about having to relive the fall of the Black Forge.<br><br>Without many other options and in order not to attract more attention, you agree to enter the tunnel in the hopes of finding a way to return to your time.
e_uprising1_a_rp3=Cornelius? But that's me... right?
e_uprising1_a_rp3_s=The soldier is confused, but the one who is even more confused than usual is old Cornelius... To avoid causing a scene, you take Cornelius and agree to enter the tunnel. As you approach, Cornelius has a moment of lucidity and says:<br><br>(Cornelius) "Oh... I see, we're in the past. This must be when those damn dwarves started building machines and attacked my people... They killed dozens of members of the Burning Hand, including my son and his wife.<br><br>When advisor Amelia came with her army, I voluntarily joined her to seek revenge and put an end to the machines that harmed my people. Although I don't remember very well how everything ended..."
e_uprising1_a_rp4=Follow me into the tunnel and give me a moment.
e_uprising1_a_rp4_s=Wilbur urges you to follow him, and when he reaches the tunnel, he takes out one of his books and starts flipping through the pages, after a while he says:<br><br>(Wilbur) "As I suspected... mmm... it must have been the rift we crossed, but without a doubt we are in the past, specifically 30 years ago.<br><br>At that time, I was studying some dwarven engineering books in the Black Forge, when the dwarven uprising happened and I was kicked out of there. I joined Amelia's group to help her and, in the process, pick up those books.<br><br>I have the feeling that we were destined to come to the past, I still can't confirm it... but the way events happened, it could be that... Anyway, our only option to return to our time is to go forward."
e_uprising1_a_rp5=Something's not right... it seems as if...
e_uprising1_a_rp5_s=When the soldier sees Nezglekt he gets nervous and is about to raise the alarm. Luckily, Nezglekt quickly hypnotizes him and begins to read his mind, shortly after he says:<br><br>(Nezglekt) "Aha, I see... it seems like we're in the past, specifically about 30 years ago. It must have been because of the rift we crossed.<br><br>It seems that at this time the Black Forge was still in operation and that it was just after this uprising that it was closed down. I've always been curious to see what it was like... Anyway, I detect a temporal energy similar to the crack we came from inside the forge. If we want to return to our time, we will have to go in and find it."
e_uprising4_a_nm=The magma forge
e_uprising4_a_dsc=You arrive at one of the main forges of the dwarven city. Here the dwarves use the magma from inside the volcano to create all kinds of artifacts.<br><br>It seems that this forge has been neglected for a few days and you don't see any dwarves around... probably due to the war and the new energy source from the activation of the ancient machine.<br><br>To one side of the forge, you see a small service robot that might be useful to you, but it is missing its chassis and main arm.
e_uprising4_a_dsca=Looking around the forge you find several chassis that you can install on the robot.
e_uprising4_a_rp0=Install the balanced chassis on the robot.
e_uprising4_a_rp0_s=You install the chassis on the robot. As it still lacks the main arm to be fully operational, you decide to take the robot with you in the hope of finding the missing part later.<br><br>Luckily, while working on the robot, you have found several interesting objects around this forge.<br><br>You quickly grab what you need and follow the trail of the vanguard group, which has undoubtedly passed this way.
e_uprising4_a_rp1=Install the heavy chassis on the robot.
e_uprising4_a_rp1_s=rptd_e_uprising4_a_rp0_s
e_uprising4_a_rp2=Install the spiked chassis on the robot.
e_uprising4_a_rp2_s=rptd_e_uprising4_a_rp0_s
e_uprising5_a_nm=The energy forge
e_uprising5_a_dsc=You arrive at one of the main forges of the dwarven city. This forge has recently been redesigned to harness the energy coming from the ancient machine in order to build all sorts of new artifacts.<br><br>Curiously, you find no dwarves in the forge, but you do see several weapons and tools on the floor. You realize that the vanguard group has most likely passed this way and vacated the forge.<br><br>To one side of the forge, you see a small service robot that might be useful to you, but it is missing its chassis and main arm.

e_uprising5_a_rp2_s=rptd_e_uprising4_a_rp0_s
e_uprising6_a_nm=The stuck elevator
e_uprising6_a_dsc=You reach the elevator leading to the next floor of the dwarven city, but it is stopped on the floor above you.<br><br>You try to call it up using a small lever, but unfortunately, it doesn't work.<br><br>After examining the lever, you realize that the mechanism is missing a small gear, and without it there is no way to bring it down from the floor above.
e_uprising6_a_dsca=Your only chance to get to the next floor is to climb up the elevator chain. 
e_uprising6_a_rp0=Try to climb up the chain one after the other.
e_uprising6_a_rp0_s=You manage to climb the chain to the next floor without difficulty.
e_uprising6_a_rp0_f=As you are climbing the chain, your strength weakens and you fall, breaking a couple of bones.<br><br>Those who have climbed up come down with the elevator to pick you up.
e_uprising6_a_rp1=I know where the missing gear is...
e_uprising6_a_rp1_s=(Amelia) "I remember back then we thought we wouldn't have reinforcements and we were worried the dwarves would ambush us from behind. So Wilbur suggested we disable the elevator's calling mechanism and hide the missing gear nearby.<br><br>I'm going to pick it up and call the elevator... although I'm worried about the implications of meeting my younger self... and the consequences that would trigger."<br><br>Amelia calls the elevator and you all go up to the next floor with it.
e_uprising6_a_rp2=I have several of these gears with me and can repair the mechanism.
e_uprising6_a_rp2_s=(Nenukil) "Ha... I remember telling Amelia that removing the gear would be of little use. Since any dwarf worth his salt in this forge always carries that type of gear with him... How ironic that I am the one who is going to replace that gear.<br><br>Even so, I have a hard time believing that we are here again... Maybe this time I can avoid what happened and save the forge..."<br><br>Nenukil calls the elevator while he mutters to himself and you all go up to the next floor with it.
e_uprising6_a_rp3=I can't believe I'm in this damn forge again...
e_uprising6_a_rp3_s=(Cornelius) "This has to be a nightmare, I must be dreaming again... Although my companions are different this time and the heat is very real...<br><br>I remember that in this elevator Amelia and Wilbur hid something over there. Then when we went up we fought tirelessly and faced the dwarven war machine... and the explosions happened..."<br><br>Cornelius looks quite tired and bewildered. While he rests for a while, you look in the place he indicated and find the missing gear to call elevator.
e_uprising6_a_rp4=I hid the missing gear over there, I'm going to pick it up.
e_uprising6_a_rp4_s=(Wilbur) "After studying for several months in the forge, I knew perfectly well that hiding this gear to disable the elevator would not be of much use...<br><br>Even so, I suggested to Amelia that hopefully we would delay a possible dwarven ambush from the rear and give us some time to complete our mission and pick up my study books on the way."<br><br>Wilbur calls the elevator and you all go up to the next floor with it.
e_uprising6_a_rp5=I will climb the chain alone and bring the elevator down!
e_uprising6_a_rp5_s=Using your excellent scouting skills, you climb the chain without any problems.<br><br>When you are on the top floor, you take the elevator down to pick up the others.
e_uprising6_a_rp5_f=You start to climb the chain and halfway up you get careless and fall, breaking a couple of bones.<br><br>Before the others can stop you, you endure the pain and quickly climb back up the chain. When you reach the top, you take the elevator down to pick up the others.
e_uprising6_a_rp6=Sss... I will climb the chain alone and bring the elevator down!

e_uprising9_a_nm=The dwarven armory
e_uprising9_a_dsc=You arrive at the main armory of the Black Forge, which seems to have been recently vacated.<br><br>Unfortunately for you, the armory is practically empty and you can't find any useful weapons.<br><br>However, you find several parts that you could use to repair the service robot and use them as its main arm.
e_uprising9_a_dsca=Which part do you want to keep?
e_uprising9_a_rp0=Choose a disc launcher as the robot's arm.
e_uprising9_a_rp0_s=You take the part with you in the hope of being able to attach it to the robot later.<br><br>Without wasting any more time, you continue forward in search of the vanguard group.

e_uprising10_a_dsc=In front of you, you see a large robot factory. No doubt this is where the dwarves assemble many of their machines, including their war machines.<br><br>No doubt the vanguard group has just passed through here and has already taken charge of disabling the factory and evacuating the dwarven engineers.<br><br>You search the factory and find several parts that you could use to repair the service robot and use them as its main arm.

e_uprising12_a_nm=The dwarf sergeant
e_uprising12_a_dsc=You see a dwarf with a stiff stance looking severe. His gaze is on the elevator, until it stops in the upper levels. He turns and speaks to you.<br><br>(Dwarf) “Argh... I am Thorim, son of Thukli, the sergeant of this floor. By the way, where the hell has the elevator warden gone. He better have a good excuse for not being here.<br><br>If you want to use the elevator, it is not open for you. Continue on your way and don’t make me repeat it.”
e_uprising12_a_dsca=Thorim's hand is close to his weapon. How do you react?
e_uprising12_a_rp0=It is imperative that we reach the upper floor. There is an emergency.
e_uprising12_a_rp0_s=(Thorim) “Argh... What are you talking about? Although... that could explain why the warden is not in his position. And we had some problems this week. I trust you, but let’s make it quick before anyone sees us. I am risking my beard helping you!”<br><br>The dwarf presses the button and calls for the elevator, but a group of dwarf soldiers arrive in a hurry.<br><br>You can see in Thorim's eyes that he can no longer control the situation and he is forced to fight you, alongside with his troops.
e_uprising12_a_rp0_f=(Thorim) “Argh... You think I am a fool? The only elevator that you are going to use is the one that goes to the cells!<br><br>Soldiers, attack! Capture them!”<br><br>Thorim's stance is steady as a mountain. He is determined not to let you pass. 
e_uprising12_a_rp1=Argh... You are a dwarf of honor, I respect that! Let’s fight like true dwarves!
e_uprising12_a_rp1_s=(Thorim) “Argh That’s how a true dwarf speaks. I will have a baby soon, and I hope my child becomes as strong as you... But wiser!<br><br>It is not very smart to challenge me here, argh... I will teach you a lesson that your parents should have taught you long ago.”<br><br>The dwarf shouts something in his language and shortly after a patrol joins him.<br><br>Thorim shouts a challenge at Grukli and charges him. His troops attack the rest of the party.   
e_uprising12_a_rp2=Thorim, you old rascal, you owe me one. We need to get into that elevator.
e_uprising12_a_rp2_s=(Thorim) “Wait, who are you? NO WAY! Nenukil? What happened to you? You look so old.<br><br>Argh... I just received a promotion; I can’t help you without risking my beard and my position! I will have a baby soon to take care of, but... I am a dwarf of honor... I will help you. And we are even. Just don’t do anything to get me fired!”<br><br>The dwarf presses the button and calls for the elevator, but a group of dwarf soldiers arrive in a hurry and charge you.<br><br>Thorim has lost control of the situation and a fight is the only possible outcome.
e_uprising12_a_rp3=I am the expert consultant. They are waiting for me to inspect the core.
e_uprising12_a_rp3_s=(Thorim) “Argh... I haven’t heard anything about a consultant, but it is true that there are rumors that the core is unstable. Is this one of those things that doesn’t have to be included in the reports? Again?”<br><br>The dwarf turns to call the elevator, gibbering something in dwarven.<br><br>A group of dwarves join him and speak with him. You can see in Thorim's eyes that he totally believed you. He is angry now and fights you alongside his troops.  
e_uprising12_a_rp4=I am the advisor of the king of Senenthia. Let us pass.
e_uprising12_a_rp4_s=(Thorim) “Argh... you think you can trick me to let you get into the elevator? I saw the advisor a few weeks ago when she visited the forge and she is much more beautiful and younger than you! Guards! To me!<br><br>You prepare for combat, and Amelia whispers to you:<br><br>(Amelia) “Too bad... the other time it worked out with the elevator warden. He let us pass and abandoned his post. I guess I am not as beautiful as my younger self." 
e_uprising13_a_nm=Ominous workshop
e_uprising13_a_dsc=You leave the elevator, and soon you realize the importance of this place: An energy collector is gathering energy from the ancient machine and bumping that power into the workbenches scattered around the area.<br><br>The energy collector buzzes and emits an unsettling noise, as if it were struggling to manage all the power that it is absorbing.<br><br>Looking around, you realize that the vanguard group passed this way, as there are lot of defeated dwarves laying on the ground.
e_uprising13_a_dsca=Those workbenches are perfect to install the arm on your robot.
e_uprising13_a_rp0=You assemble the robot and rest a bit.
e_uprising13_a_rp0_s=Assembling the robot was easier than expected. The rest of the group found several interesting things among the dwarves and the workbenches.<br><br>You catch some breath while splitting the loot.
e_uprising13_a_rp1=I can assemble the robot and craft an extra pair of rocket boots!
e_uprising13_a_rp1_s=Nenukil assembles the robot with ease while the rest of the party loot the area for something useful.<br><br>When they come back, Nenukil even had the time to make a new pair or rocket boots with the spare parts that he found around.<br><br>You catch some breath while splitting the loot. 
e_uprising13_a_rp2=Beep! I can assemble the model 1138: Scrappy, with 100% efficiency. 
e_uprising13_a_rp2_s=Heiner assembles the robot quickly and efficiently. He uses the spare parts to upgrade his lasers.<br><br>The rest of the party scavenge the area for something of use. When they come back, Heiner is proudly waiting with his shiny new laser and “scrappy” at his side.<br><br>You catch some breath while splitting the loot. 
e_uprising14_a_nm=A fated intervention
e_uprising14_a_dsc=You are about to reach the vanguard group. They are giving it all in their fight against an impressive war machine and the general that commands it. But they don’t seem able to last much longer.<br><br>A reinforcement group is on its way to support the dwarven general, but they have to move at the pace of their own war machine, a model you have never seen before.<br><br>You need to do something! The group can barely hold against one war machine; another one would be devastating. 
e_uprising14_a_dsca=You are not going to let those reinforcements reach their target.
e_uprising14_a_rp0=You move to intercept the dwarven reinforcements.
e_uprising14_a_rp0_s=You move as fast as you can to intercept the second war machine and avoid a disadvantageous situation for the vanguard group.
e_uprising14_a_rp1=Now I understand why the reinforces didn’t come that day.
e_uprising14_a_rp1_s=(Amelia) “When we were struggling in our fight against the general, I realized that dwarven reinforcements were coming, but they never arrived.<br><br>I thought a group of irregular troops helped us by delaying the enemy reinforcements. Now I know exactly what happened. It was us!<br><br>It is imperative we stop them.”<br><br>Amelia uses her magic to block the enemy’s path, and the reinforcements turn their attention on you.
e_uprising14_a_rp2=That’s general Thugmir! He made it work...
e_uprising14_a_rp2_s=(Nenukil) “So that’s what Thugmir was doing at that time, uh? The project DT-209... He made some changes to my designs though.<br><br>We had a rough time fighting the other general that time, if Thugmir had attacked us with his DT-209, we wouldn’t have had a chance.<br><br>But... uh! The accident! We must stop him before that happens!”<br><br>Nenukill uses his rocket boots to push himself and intercept the enemy reinforcements. The rest of the party arrives just in time for the fight. 
e_uprising14_a_rp3=This is bad! We need to hurry! I know what that model is capable of!
e_uprising14_a_rp3_s=(Wilbur) “The battle against the dwarven general was extremely exhausting, and I didn’t realize a DT-209 was coming as a reinforcement! It is fascinating to have this chance of examining it closer.<br><br>I have read some interesting facts about that model, but as far as I am aware, that model never evolved beyond the prototype phase. This may be the only chance to see it in action!"<br><br>Wilbur accelerates his flying platform and stands between the vanguard group and the reinforcements, drawing their attention. 
e_uprising14_a_rp4=Oh... that smell... I remember it. Here is where everything happened!
e_uprising14_a_rp4_s=Cornelius is unable to move. You can see on his face the myriad of emotions crossing his mind.<br><br>The group looks confused. You need him for the upcoming battle, but he seems lost in his thoughts.<br><br>The group yells at him and in a moment of clarity, Cornelius casts a fireball in front of the enemy reinforcements, forcing them to focus their attention on you. 
e_uprising14_b_nm=A fated accident
e_uprising14_b_dsc=With the dwarven general and his retinue defeated, you are ready to join the vanguard group on their fight, but a loose missile from the war machine they are facing strikes the energy collector.<br><br>The explosion of the missile causes a malfunction in the complex device and several explosions happen along the ancient machine it is attached to.<br><br>Chaos is everywhere as the place starts to crumble, but the other dwarven general is ready for a last stand.
e_uprising14_b_dsca=You see in young Cornelius' eyes the determination of someone who has a made a decision.
e_uprising14_b_rp0=You see how young Cornelius summons a powerful demon. 
e_uprising14_b_rp0_s=A powerful demon appears as a result of Cornelius summoning. You recognize him as Belphyor, lord of the imps. He will do Cornelius' bidding... this time.<br><br>Without wasting a second, young Cornelius commands Belphyor to hold the dwarven general and the imminent explosion. As the demon agrees, young Cornelius falls to the ground, severely weakened.<br><br>While young Wilbur and young Nenukil help the semi-conscious young Cornelius, you realize that young Amelia is gesturing at you to follow her, as she seems to know a way out, while the demon holds the enemy.
e_uprising15_a_nm=The end of the uprising
e_uprising15_a_dsc=When you are about to reach young Amelia and escape the forge, a rift appears between your party and her. This portal is like the one that brought you here.<br><br>You can’t waste this opportunity to go back to the present and without thinking twice, you cross the rift.<br><br>Just before going back to your time, you are able to see how the explosions and the lava engulf the Black Forge.
e_uprising15_a_dsca=That is how your adventure in the past ends. 
e_uprising15_a_rp0=You are back in present Velkarath. 
e_uprising15_a_rp0_s=History tells that when advisor Amelia came back to Senenthia, she reported what happened in the Black Forge.<br><br>In her report, she wrote about a group of irregular soldiers that helped her and her party to end with the Obsidian Uprising, but unfortunately, that group didn’t survive. To honor that group, a monument was built in the city of Velkarath.<br><br>Advisor Amelia rewarded the three heroes who helped her, and she forgave the surviving dwarves of the Black Forge, as long as they swear to abandon the research and machinery they produced during the Obsidian Uprising.  
e_uprising15_a_rp1=It has been an... interesting experience.
e_uprising15_a_rp1_s=(Amelia) “Today’s events helped me to understand some details that I didn’t know about the uprising event. I reported that a group of irregulars helped us to quell the uprising, but they didn’t make it out of the Forge. I never expected that I myself was part of that group!<br><br>That experience forged a bond between Nenukil, Wilbur, Cornelius and me. I offered them a reward after that, whatever they wanted.<br><br>Wilbur asked for help with his new research, Nenukil asked to become part of my retinue and Cornelius asked me... a personal favor.” 
e_uprising15_a_rp2=It’s a shame, I couldn’t stop it.   
e_uprising15_a_rp2_s=(Nenukil) “I thought I could change how things went that time. We were so close... Those opportunistic generals doomed a lot of my people and tainted our good name. I will never forgive them.<br><br>After that event, I asked Amelia to be fair with the surviving dwarves and I swore to join her as her loyal vassal.<br><br>Amelia accepted. The surviving dwarves could establish in Senenthia, and I was at her side until the day she decided to exile herself in order to protect us all."
e_uprising15_a_rp3=Is it really over? At last?
e_uprising15_a_rp3_s=Cornelius calms once he realizes he is out of the Forge.<br><br>(Cornelius) “Now I remember this nightmare clearly. I did what I had to do in order to save us all.<br><br>The fight against the dwarf general was exhausting. I was weakened, at my limit, and summoning Belphyor took a great toll on my mind and strength.<br><br>I knew my mind would start to fail me soon and I wouldn’t be able to take care of the only person I had left, my newborn granddaughter, Evelyn. So, before things got worse, I asked Amelia to take care of her."
e_uprising15_a_rp4=So after all this time...
e_uprising15_a_rp4_s=(Wilbur) “Since that day, I have always been obsessed with a cool dwarf on a floating machine that I saw down there.<br><br>A dwarf on a floating machine, moving through the battlefield with ease and grace. I only saw it in passing, but I couldn’t focus on him, because that general was a very hard fight!<br><br>And now everything is clear. Of course, it shouldn’t surprise me. It wasn’t a dwarf. The great inspiration of my life is... myself!”
e_faen2_b_nm=Everyday magic
e_faen2_b_dsc=Along the way, you meet a white-haired elven woman who seems a bit depressed.<br><br>When you ask her why, she tells you that her hobby is traveling to find new spells. But she is short of money, having spent it all on a good meal at the Happy Owl.<br><br>The elf offers to teach you one of her most useful spells in exchange for 300g, so she can get some money to continue her journey.

Don't worry about the smell."<br><br>As the others are about to enter, an old harpoon falls off the wall and the noise brings unexpected company.
e_aquar27_b_rp6=Wait a moment, I have seen this place before. 
e_aquar27_b_rp6_s=(Nezglekt) "In my visions, there was a trap right there. Be careful not to spring it."<br><br>As the others are about to enter, an old harpoon falls off the wall and the noise brings unexpected company. You feel Nezglekt's look of disappointment. 
e_aquar27_c_rp5=rptd_e_aquar27_b_rp5

e_aquar27_c_rp6_s=rptd_e_aquar27_b_rp6_s
e_aquar42_b_rp4=You are that popular frog minstrel! I heard you on Faeborg. I will help you! 
e_aquar42_b_rp4_s=(Gustav) "Croak! Indeed I am! The one and only Gustav.<br><br>In fact, as I said, the lute I want is in one of the elven mansions in Faeborg, croak...<br><br>Thanks for helping me; here is some of the money I have raised on my tour. I hope it helps."
e_faen15_a_rp2=Indulge this old werewolf, Bree. Let's spar together. 
e_faen15_a_rp2_s=During the sparring fight, Magnus seems to have his mind elsewhere. It looks like he had fought this combat hundreds of times in his head.<br><br>After a while, the fight stops. In the end, Magnus learned more from Bree than he expected. 
e_faen15_a_rp3=Would you like to spar with me like when we were younger, Bree? 
e_faen15_a_rp3_s=The two friends spar together, giving it their all. The fight is quite fun to watch, as the two contestants do their best to showcase what they have learned since their last sparring match.<br><br>They finish the sparring session amicably and complimenting each other technique.<br><br>Andrin learned some techniques from Bree.
e_faen15_a_rp4=This is so different from my home! Could you teach me more?
e_faen15_a_rp4_s=After teaching her some things about the forest, she shows the feline warrior how to fight in this particular scenario, which tactics she prefers and how she adapts to the ever changing battlefield.<br><br>After the training, Bree sees that Laila’s eyes are bright with true admiration.<br><br>Bree gives a bolt of cloth to Laia, that she proudly attaches to a stick and uses it as a banner, as Bree taught her. 
e_faen18_a_rp5=Croak... I can brighten the mood and earn some coins!
e_faen18_a_rp5_s=Gustav walks to the center of the inn and starts playing his lute.<br><br>The guests at the inn are not interested in the music at first, but as Gustav's performance goes on, the people are more and more interested.<br><br>When Gustav finishes, there is general applause and some of them even deposit some money in the tip jar. 
e_faen18_a_rp5_f=Gustav walks to the center of the inn and starts playing his lute.<br><br>The guests at the inn are not interested in the music at first, but as Gustav's performance goes on, the people are even less interested. At all.<br><br>Before Gustav can finish, the innkeeper asks Gustav to stop, as the people are not in the mood to hear his music. Gustav feels devastated. 
e_faen2_a_rp7=It's not looking good, buddy, what about a little good old honor among thieves?
e_faen2_a_rp7_s=The thief quickly realizes that there is no point in discussing this with Yogger and tells him that the stolen items are in a hidden path near the Forest Entrance.<br><br>Yogger laughs and moves on, leaving the thief to his fate.
e_faen38_a_rp3=How dare you to come back and do this to my people!
e_faen38_a_rp3_s=(Sylvie) "I remember that when I was a child and I did some mischief, my parents told me stories about how mighty dragon Faeborg would come and eat me and my friends.<br><br>You can't imagine how I felt when I saw you descend from the sky, freezing it all. I used to fear you. But not anymore. You will pay for all you have done to my people."<br><br>Sylvie takes a deep breath and prepares her bow, while she orders Harley to look for a weak point on Faeborg.
e_faen38_a_rp4=Argh! I never thought I would face a dragon! Bring it on!
e_faen38_a_rp4_s=Grukli's furious battle cry echoes from the mountain while he charges Faeborg.<br><br>You all feel Grukli's passion, and for a moment, you forget about the cold. You join him in the charge. 
e_faen38_a_rp5=Hehe, I was able to retrieve my lantern, thanks to you.
e_faen38_a_rp5_s=(Zek) "Since my exile, I have been waiting for a chance to come back. Who would have thought it would be thanks to a crazy dragon? Now be a good dragon and let me try something on you".<br><br>Zek whispers a curse, but it doesn't seem to be very effective on Faeborg.
e_faen38_a_rp6=Oh! Could it be that you are that young azure dragon...
e_faen38_a_rp6_s=(Navalea) "When I was in the war I heard some of my fellow architects talk about a young azure dragon that was nesting in one of our obelisks. Even if that could be a problem, we had more pressing matters on our hands by that time...<br><br>It is impressive how big and powerful you became, but your power is utterly useless against me. Your cold means nothing to me."<br><br>With a flick of her hand, Navalea uses Faeborg's very own frost to protect the party. 
e_secta4_a_rp6=This pit emanates darkness. I could use it...
e_secta4_a_rp6_s=Dark energies from the pit surrounds Navalea, who absorb them with ease.
e_sen21_a_rp6=Oh, you lived here? Where are Basthet symbols?
e_sen21_a_rp6_s=Ottis looks a bit nervous, not knowing how to tell Laia that he doesn't have any Basthet symbol. But he manages distract her by teaching how he prays. 
e_sen21_a_rp7=So here is where you were hiding, little pig.
e_sen21_a_rp7_s=(Yogger) "Be a good pig and show me the treasures you have been hiding. NOW."<br><br>Yogger laughs while a scared Ottis obeys, before the group can do anything. 
e_sen20_b_rp5=I fought alongside this piece of junk in the wolf wars. 
e_sen20_b_rp5_s=(Yogger) "This thing can be useful to bring havoc and expand my domain. They used it against my kind, and now I will use it against them!<br><br>I heard they made them in the Black Forge of Velkarath. We should look there for a replacement."<br><br> As you hide the golem so that it does not suffer any more damage, you find a few magic shards.
e_sen5_a_rp8=In the name of Basthet, I will find your son!
e_sen5_a_rp8_s=(Laia) "I need no reward good man, as the glory of Basthet will guide me and fulfilling her will is the only reward I need!"<br><br>The baker looks surprised at how vehemently Laia speaks about that so-called "Basthet"<br><br>He insists that you can use whatever you want from an old chest next to the mill.
e_sen6_a1_rp6=I feel a curse here. Leave it to me. 
e_sen6_a1_rp6_s=Navalea whispers some words, and the aura vanishes instantly.<br><br>After digging, you find a small chest and a strange key with a jewel. The key does not belong to the chest, and you don't know what it can be used for.<br><br>You open the chest.
e_ulmin30_b_rp2=I know.
e_ulmin30_b_rp2_s=Navalea's answer is as cold as her eyes. Laia doesn't find the words to reply to her and follows Navalea into the catacombs, in silence.<br><br>The rest of the group follows them. 
e_velka16_b_rp2=Wilbur, old friend...
e_velka16_b_rp2_s=(Amelia) "I am in a hurry, but I will keep an eye open for you. Although I prefer you to restrain yourself to magical research, as we have seen how dangerous technology can be on the wrong hands, I trust you will use that knowledge wisely"<br><br>The gnome thanks you for your willingness and gives you a few magic shards.<br><br>Also, the gnome tells you that he has already searched half the world, so it will be difficult to find a book that he has not seen... Unless it is in a place that can only be reached across the obelisks.<br><br>Before leaving, you rest a little in the camp.
e_aquar6_a_rp6=I know the crocomen's leader. Let’s help him.
e_aquar6_a_rp6_s=Irwin, the crocomen's leader is glad to see that Yogger is at his side.<br><br>The battle begins and the leader of the lizardmen, Sauron angered by your decision attacks you.<br><br>But the crocomen's grave roar encourages you to fight even harder than usual!
e_aquar6_a2_rp2=Come on, Irwin, you owe me more than this. 
e_aquar6_a2_rp2_s=Yogger and Irwin are used to doing business together, and they speak for a while in their own jargon.<br><br>Irwin seems pleased with the conversation and the deals with Yogger.<br><br>Irwin offers you an extra tip for being on Yogger's side and permission to use one of his boats.
e_aquar13_a_rp4=I have the proper concoction for this. 
e_aquar13_a_rp4_s=(Malukah) “We have problems with the spiders quite often, so I developed a potion able to deal with their cocoons in the most painless and effective way possible.<br><br>I always carry some with me. They smell very nice and repel minor insects too. Powerful mojo, this potion.”<br><br>Malukah pours the concoction on the cocoons and they stop moving shortly after. Some of them open, giving you access to their previous inhabitants’ belongings. 
e_aquar22_a_rp6=I bet I can hit them from here. 
e_aquar22_a_rp6_s=Nenukil gets some special bullets from his pouch and loads his weapon.<br><br>He aims carefully and shoots at the mosquitoes. He reloads and repeats several times until he decides to blow the nest with his last special bullet.<br><br>You realize that he used this shootout as an excuse to hone his reloading skills. 
e_aquar48_a_nm=Smuggler's stash
e_aquar48_a_dsc=Something in the swamp trees catches your eye.<br><br>A pack of boxes are around one of the trees, not very well hidden. It would not be difficult to maneuver the boat to that position.<br><br>You wonder if the owner is so confident that no one will touch these boxes, or if they are marked for someone else to find them, like smugglers usually do.
e_aquar48_a_dsca=Will you dare to get close and take a look?
e_aquar48_a_rp0=You don’t have time for this.
e_aquar48_a_rp0_s=Those boxes look suspicious. Better leave them alone.<br><br>They are not your business. You are not savages, stealing and breaking everything you find. You are on a mission to rescue the princess!<br><br>You continue your journey without giving it a second thought. 
e_aquar48_a_rp1=A pack of boxes in the middle of nowhere... Whatever they contain will be yours.
e_aquar48_a_rp1_s=You maneuver the boat to the boxes, that are heavier than you expected. After a few well-placed hits, the boxes are open.<br><br>You have access to their contents: a stash of weapons and equipment.<br><br>The equipment is in good condition to be used, so you decide to take a closer look. 
e_aquar48_a_rp1_f=You maneuver the boat to the boxes, that are heavier than you expected. After some hits, the boxes still denying you their contents.<br><br>It seems the noise attracted undesired attention and before you realize it, you are defending yourselves from an attack by angry crocomen. Probably the owners of the boxes. 
e_aquar48_a_rp1_sc=You maneuver the boat to the boxes, that are heavier than you expected. After a few well-placed hits, the boxes are open.<br><br>You have access to their contents: a stash of weapons and equipment and some gold.<br><br>It seems that this is not only equipment, but bribes too. Whatever its purpose was, the contents are yours now. 
e_aquar48_a_rp1_fc=You maneuver the boat to the boxes, that are heavier than you expected. You hit them as hard as you can, but they don’t open.<br><br>You continue hitting the boxes for a while, but they are sturdier than you expected.<br><br>While you are distracted with the boxes, a group of crocomen attacks you. You barely have time to react before the fight starts.  
e_aquar48_a_rp2=Oh! This is Irwin's symbol.
e_aquar48_a_rp2_s=(Yogger) “This looks like some of the equipment that Irwin sends me as part of our agreement. They are probably storing it here before sending me the next batch.<br><br>We have a profitable agreement and his people know their craft. Their equipment is reliable.<br><br>Now that I am here, I will take a look. Surely there is something useful.”
e_aquar48_a_rp3=Sss... I can open this without a noise. 
e_aquar48_a_rp3_s=(Thuls) “Thissss belongs to the smugglers. But don’t worry, they are slow and clumsy.<br><br>I believe they send these things to a bandit gang in Senenthia’s forest sss...<br><br>There, it is open. Let’s see if there is something useful sss...”
e_aquar48_a_rp4=Hey! I know what this is!
e_aquar48_a_rp4_s=(Andrin) “I have seen boxes like this in Senenthia’s forest.<br><br>I tracked them down one time, and I discovered that they come from the crocomen of the swamps. Senenthia’s bandits are getting some equipment from them. They seem to have an agreement or something.<br><br>I have seen those guys opening these boxes hundreds of times, there is a little trick... Here. Let’s see what we got!”
e_aquar48_a_rp5=So they get it from here?
e_aquar13_a_rp5_s=(Bree) “I have seen that symbol on the gear of the werewolves that plague Senenthia’s forest. Their equipment is as pathetic as they are. But if you want to open it, don’t waste your time, leave it to me.”<br><br>Without thinking twice, Bree crushes the top of each box with her axe.<br><br>It seems that the contents are intact, be it by pure luck or because they are sturdier than Bree gives them credit for.
e_aquar48_a_rp6=Beep... I can open the boxes with a rate success of 99.99% success.
e_aquar13_a_rp6_s=(Heiner) “Beep... These boxes are made of bald cypress lumber, iron nails and a layer of paint made with local plants and insects. They are not sturdy enough to resist the strength I am able to apply. Awaiting instructions... Beep.”<br><br>You nod to Heiner, and without wasting a second, he bends the top of the box with a mixture of raw strength and delicacy that you didn’t expect from him.<br><br>The contents are intact and you can loot them without problems. 
e_aquar48_a_rp7=Argh! What are they hiding! Take me there!
e_aquar13_a_rp7_s=Once you are close enough for Grukli to reach the boxes, he grabs his axe and brutalize the boxes in a savage way.<br><br>You have never seen someone hate some boxes so much. You are sure that the boxes' owners must hear you, but at the same time, you are quite sure that no one would dare get between Grukli and the boxes. Once the boxes are reduced to splinters, Grukli laughs and sits in the boat.<br><br>Somehow, the contents of the boxes are intact, and you can loot them while the half-dwarf sits laughing. 
e_aquar48_a_rp8=This is where smugglers hide their things.
e_aquar13_a_rp8_s=(Malukah) “This place is where the crocomen gather their goods before sending them to their customers.<br><br>Sometimes they even buy my potions to include among their goods, but they always pay me a fair price or help me acquire some... special ingredients for my concoctions.<br><br>Among the dwellers of the swamp, we respect each other, so if you want to get something from that boxes, I will make a deal with their leader and pay him later. Our mission requires all the help that we can find.”
e_velka42_a_nm=A bridge too far
e_velka42_a_dsc=The harpies' shriek echoes in the distance while you cross the bridge.<br><br>You are almost at the other side when you see the harpies gather above you.<br><br>It seems that they have detected you. 
e_velka42_a_dsca=What do you want to do?
e_velka42_a_rp0=You run to the other side. 
e_velka42_a_rp0_s=As the other side is near, you decide to sprint to reach it as fast as you can.<br><br>The harpies didn’t have time to band together so they leave, looking for easier prey.<br><br>You are surprised that your group was so well coordinated. It seems that time traveling together is paying off!
e_velka42_a_rp0_f=The other side is close, and you rush your moves without any kind of organization. Soon there is only chaos on the bridge, as everyone tries to reach the other side as fast as they can.<br><br>While you are busy trying to reach safety, the harpies make their move and steal some of your gold.<br><br>Your purse is not as hurt as your pride, as you are really upset that after all this time traveling together, you haven’t learned better team tactics. 
e_velka42_a_rp0_fc=The other side is close, and you rush your moves without any kind of organization. Soon there is only chaos on the bridge, as everyone tries to reach the other side as fast as they can.<br><br>While you are busy pushing each other, the harpies quickly rush to your position and not only steal from you but also hurt you with their claws.<br><br>Your purse and your pride are hurt, but not as much as your bodies, as the harpies managed to inflict some open wounds that you need to tend to before you continue.
e_velka42_a_rp1=You get into a defensive stance.
e_velka42_a_rp1_s=You know that with hurry comes unnecessary risk, so you prepare to repel the harpies if they get too close.<br><br>The harpies rush your position, trying to steal something, but they can’t find any gap in your stance. They decide to look for easier prey, and you are able to cross the bridge without incident.<br><br>You learned a lot from this experience, and you feel how your defensive skills have improved. 
e_velka42_a_rp1_f=You set your defensive stance flawlessly, but the harpies outsmart you. They see that it is impossible to penetrate your defenses, so they attack the bridge instead!<br><br>When the bridge starts to shake, you decide it is too risky to stay there and you run to the safe ground. That is when the harpies take the chance to steal some of your gold.<br><br>Those harpies were very clever and stole some coins from you.
e_velka42_a_rp1_sc=You have done this more times that you can count in your time traveling together.<br><br>Without thinking, you adopt a defensive formation that the harpies are unable to penetrate. The harpies insist on testing your defense for a few minutes, but they are repelled each time they get dangerously close.<br><br>They finally flee in frustration, probably in the search of easier prey, and you are able to cross the bridge.<br><br>You learned a lot from this experience and you feel how your defensive skills have improved a lot. 
e_velka42_a_rp1_fc=Your defensive stance is a joke. The group is unorganized and nobody knows exactly which is their spot in the formation.<br><br>While you try to organize the defense, the harpies rush you and are able to steal from you at their pleasure. In the following struggle, you also suffer some wounds and scratches.<br><br>Once they have what they want, they flee before you can properly fight back. It is clear that your teamwork needs to improve. A lot. 
e_velka42_a_rp2=Time to shoot! 
e_velka42_a_rp2_s=Sylvie prepares some arrows and shoots at the harpies. The harpies try to harass you, but the skilled elf keeps them at bay.<br><br>The harpies realize that each arrow is closer to hitting the target than the previous one, and they decide that whatever goods you are carrying are not worth the price of an arrow in the chest.<br><br>Once the harpies flee, the group crosses the bridge without any trouble. 
e_velka42_a_rp3=Harpies... Let me try something.
e_velka42_a_rp3_s=As the skillful elementalist that she is, Evelyn combines the elements and casts a powerful unnatural storm of fire, thunder and cold close to where the harpies are.<br><br>Evelyn seems tired, but satisfied. That spell is something that only the most talented elementalist could cast!<br><br>The storm lasts long enough to make the harpies flee. You can cross the bridge without any trouble. 
e_velka42_a_rp4=This beauty can hit them at this distance. 
e_velka42_a_rp4_s=(Nenukil) “This will scare them. Not my first dance with harpies.”<br><br>The dwarf takes a box with special ammunition and loads it into his weapon.<br><br>It is clear that it is not the first time that these harpies have heard the thunderous noise of Nenukil’s weapon, as they flee in no time after first shot.<br><br>You can cross the bridge without any problem.
e_velka42_a_rp5=Pesky harpies... I know how to scare them.
e_velka42_a_rp5_s=(Wilbur) “The harpies are used to casting lightning in their favor, but a sudden unexpected thunder storm will make them flee for a moment and regroup until they discover what is happening. By that time, we should be on the other side. Now observe how my genius beats them on their own terrain. You are allowed to be amazed.”<br><br>Wilbur expertly cast a violent thunder storm on the harpies' position and as he told you, they flee.<br><br>You are able to cross the bridge without disturbance from the harpies.
e_velka42_a_rp6=I will cover us!
e_velka42_a_rp6_s=You shout a challenge at the harpies, and they answer you by yelling and rushing to your position.<br><br>They attack you from every side but their anger-fueled moves are predictable, and you can parry and deflect all their attempts to steal from you.<br><br>Once the harpies get tired and flee, you realize that the rest of the party is safe on the other side and impressed by your defensive exhibition. You learned some things from this battle too. 
e_velka42_a_rp6_f=You shout a challenge at the harpies, and they answer you by yelling and rushing to your position.<br><br>They attack you from every side, but their moves are controlled and precise. They are able to beat your defenses easily. The harpies harass you to their heart’s content, and for a while it looks like they are toying with you.<br><br>Once they get tired, they flee with some of your dignity, but they leave you some scars as a reminded. At least your brave action allowed the rest of the party to reach the other side safety.  
e_voidlow5_b_nm=The ruined plaza
e_voidlow5_b_dsc=You arrive at a ruined plaza in which countless battles seem to have been fought. The debris of black and white automatons lies scattered all over the place.<br><br>The roads ahead of you are unguarded and unattended.<br><br>You may discover something useful among the fallen guardians, but time is of the essence. 
e_voidlow5_b_dsca=What do you want to do?
e_voidlow5_b_rp0=You don’t have time for this.
e_voidlow5_b_rp0_s=Hanshek and the princess are very close! You will not waste time when your objective is so close.
e_voidlow5_b_rp1=You scavenge for something useful.
e_voidlow5_b_rp1_s=The automatons and their weapons are not in as bad a condition as you thought at first glance.<br><br>While you loot the mechanical guardians, you realize how clever their design is and how dangerous they would be in their prime.<br><br>You find some extraordinary items.
e_voidlow5_b_rp1_f=The automatons and their equipment are broken beyond repair.<br><br>Their design is very complex, and you don’t have the proper tools to do anything worthwhile.<br><br>You barely scrape together some usable items. 
e_voidlow5_b_rp1_sc=The automatons and their weapons are in better condition than you expected.<br><br>Thanks to the clever design of the automatons, some of their gear is in perfect condition.<br><br>You wonder how fearsome they would be in their prime. 
e_voidlow5_b_rp1_fc=The automatons and their equipment are broken beyond repair, so you decide to move them and see if there is something interesting lying below the heavier pieces.<br><br>With some effort you manage to move the heavy pieces of the automatons, but the process is quite dangerous due to the irregularities of the terrain caused by the battle.<br><br>Eventually, the worst happens. While the group is trying to move a heavy piece, it slips and falls on you. It is not a fatal impact, but you will remember this hit for some time. 
e_voidlow5_b_rp2=You investigate what happened here.
e_voidlow5_b_rp2_s=These are the remains of a fight between automatons so even that it lasted until their components could no longer resist the effects of time.<br><br>The automatons were infused with dark and light magic and designed to fight together, but something malfunctioned with this batch, and they fought each other until the bitter end. Judging by the destruction in the area, the idea of light and dark automatons fighting together is a scary thought.<br><br>Thanks to your investigation, you have a better understanding of how these automatons work, and you feel ready to exploit their weaknesses. 
e_voidlow5_b_rp2_f=The area is too damaged and you don’t have time, but you are able to reach some conclusions before leaving.<br><br>The automatons seem to be infused with different types of energy. At some point, the automatons started to fight those that weren’t aligned with their energy type.<br><br>It is unclear if that fight was intended or a product of a malfunction. 
e_voidlow5_b_rp3=It seems that they fought each other.
e_voidlow5_b_rp3_s=(Navalea) “We reconfigured these automatons to help us in our revolt against the archons. Even back in the day we had some problems due to the nature of their light and dark energy. Sometimes they fought each other, but we were able to fix it.<br><br>I would say that without the proper maintenance these automatons had succumbed to that malfunction. I wonder how long they fought before crumbling...<br><br>We should move on. These automatons are not going to wake up.”<br><br>Thanks to Navalea you have a better understanding of these machines. 
e_voidlow5_b_rp4=Wait a minute... I recognize these parts!
e_voidlow5_b_rp4_s=(Wilbur) “But, of course, I recognize this! These designs are described in the "Arkhon Summum Exercitus” and the “Generalis Usus Machina VIII."<br><br>According to those books, this type of automaton was adapted for several uses in the architects' society. It is said that the archons showed them how to build and keep these constructs and that knowledge was lost during the war.”<br><br>Wilbur talks for minutes about the virtues of these models and the rest of the party is extremely bored, but they know that this information may be useful in the future.
e_voidlow5_b_rp5=This is intriguing... 
e_voidlow5_b_rp5_s=(Nenukil) “This battlefield tells a story... and I don’t think I like where this is going.<br><br>The parts of these automatons... the technology that assembled them reminds me the techniques that we used in the Black Forge, but our technology was... cruder.<br><br>This is very refined and efficient! Our automatons were baby toys compared to this. This manufacture is exquisite. It is humbling to see that our technology had so much to improve. And terrifying.”<br><br>Nenukil directs you in scavenging some usable parts from the constructs.
e_voidlow5_b_rp6=I feel a great sorrow looking at this.
e_voidlow5_b_rp6_s=(Amelia) “The marks and the destruction surrounding this area... They tell a sad story. The design of these automatons is elegant, but hides a horrible truth.<br><br>These machines had the potential to build a better world, but instead they were the instruments of their master’s fall.<br><br>They are nonetheless a war prodigy and when the dwarves started to walk this path, I had to stop them long ago. Fortunately, I learned some things about fighting automatons. Let me share it with you. A machine is a machine, after all.”
e_voidlow5_b_rp7=Beep... Analyzing battlefield.
e_voidlow5_b_rp7_s=(Heiner) “Beep... Analysis complete. Proceeding to explain conclusions. Two types of automatons infused with different energies, one with dark and other with light faced each other until the degradation of their pieces caused a critical malfunction.<br><br>According to my estimations the battle last no less than 150 years uninterrupted... Beep.”<br><br>Heiner continues his analysis for a while, explaining what happened according to his interpretation of the data. You have the feeling this knowledge will be useful in the future.  
e_voidlow21_a_rp9=I remember this book. It will serve me well.
e_voidlow21_a_rp9_s=Navalea walks near the shelf, caressing the books but with her mind on another place.<br><br>(Navalea) "This library was protected with enchantments to prevent the degradation of the books... but it seems that they lost their power. I find hard to believe that the place is still... recognizable.<br><br>Libraries were very important for us, and scholars were among the most respected of the architects. I spent countless hours in these halls when I was younger. But enough of memories. Let’s resume our journey.” 
e_voidlow25_a_rp3=You can apply what we learned on that plaza. 
e_voidlow25_a_rp3_s=Thanks to what you learned back in the ruined plaza, you are better prepared to face them.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp20=You are an honorless traitor! You will pay!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp20_s=(Hanshek) “Oh! The queen’s lapdog finally shows his fangs! Why don’t you go back and play with your toys in the Black Forge?<br><br>Don’t you even dare to speak me about treason, dwarf, for your kind is the most treacherous! You know what happened in the forge, and the Queen should had made an example of your people instead of forgiving them.<br><br>You are not so clever. What is happening here is beyond your understanding. But don’t worry, I will make a demonstration that even you could understand."
e_ulmin7_a_rp4=I am sure this potion will protect us. 
e_ulmin7_a_rp4_s=(Malukah) “Who wants a sip? It tastes like coconut. It is my best anti-toxin. Or was this the best tasting one?<br><br>While you get that shiny gem, I will take a sample of the poison in the area. It will serve my research. It has an interesting mojo.”<br><br>Thanks to Malukah’s concoction you get the gem without worrying about the poison. She is pleased that her potion worked so well and that she could store some poison for later experimentation. 
e_ulmin19_a_rp2=An easy matter for one of my skills.
e_ulmin19_a_rp2_s=Wilbur rebuilds the tablet easily and you are able to continue reading it.<br><br>A few years after punishing the paladin, the herons wondered if it was the right thing to do. In their view, she had done the right thing by fighting against the Archons... So the herons questioned Basthet and asked for mercy for the paladin.<br><br>Basthet did not answer them. Eventually, the herons lost her favor and abandoned the oasis in the south of the desert.<br><br>After reading the history you are impressed by the courage shown by the herons in questioning their benefactor.
e_sen13_a_rp7=These pigmen are already lost. Allow me to show them the way home.
e_sen13_a_rp7_s=Nezglekt approaches the pigmen and talks to them.<br><br>After a long talk and an exchange with Nezglekt, the pigmen turn around and move in the opposite direction from where they were heading. When they walk near you, they don’t show any sign of acknowledging your presence.<br><br>Before you can think about it, Nezglekt tells you that they offered some of their belongings to help you in your mission. 
e_sen13_a_rp7_f=Nezglekt approaches the pigmen and starts talking to them.<br><br>When he offers them something, one of the pigmen flees in terror and the other throws a torch at Neglekt’s face.<br><br>The branded pigman summons a fire imp before you can attack him. 
e_sen13_b_rp4=Argh... Brigands! You will face a true warrior!
e_sen13_b_rp4_s=When Grukli sees the bandits, he charges them before you can think about a more subtle approach.<br><br>The bandits are surprised, as it seems that they were expecting peasants who don’t want to fight and not a crazy half-dwarf who lives for the thrill of battle. They are about to have a bad day.<br><br>By the time you join the battle, Grukli has already wounded the bandits and battered them a little.
e_sen18_b_rp6=Attack them after my shot.
e_sen18_b_rp6_s=Nenukil shoots, and one of the pigmen falls to the ground. The other pigmen get scared and run away.<br><br>When the pigmen leave, the werewolf thanks you and tells you that his name is Raúl and his brother runs a stall in the forest. If you stop by, he will thank you for what you did today.
e_sen18_b_rp6_f=Nenukil aims and fires but somehow misses the shot. You are surprised, as it was a quite easy one. Maybe he is not as good as he is always boasting.<br><br>Before he can shoot a second time, the pigmen are upon you, and the battle is up close and personal.<br><br>At least the werewolf sees an opportunity to leave, but before that, he tells you that his name is Raúl and his brother runs a stall in the forest. If you stop by, he will thank you for what you did today.
e_sen18_b_rp7=In the name of Basthet, I will save you!
e_sen18_b_rp7_s=The pigmen turn to you and look angered and surprised by Laia’s speech about how Basthet will bring justice if they don’t repent. It is clear from the pigmen's intent that they are not going to repent anything.<br><br>Before you can join her in battle, Laia has already wounded some of the pigmen, who didn’t expect her to be so skilled!<br><br>The werewolf sees an opportunity to leave, but before that he tells you that his name is Raúl and his brother runs a stall in the forest. If you happen to meet him, your actions of today will not be forgotten.
e_sen25_a_rp12=I can tell you a lot of things about Basthet!
e_sen25_a_rp12_s=(Laia) “Where to start? Maybe with the story of how Basthet kindled the sun for us! Or how she punished the first betrayer! Or how Basthet prepared the Primordial Salad!”<br><br>Laia is excited to be able to speak about her beloved Basthet and, to your surprise, the werewolves ask her for another tale when the first one is over.<br><br>When you wake up the next morning, the werewolves are still sleeping. It seems that they were listening Laia’s stories until late. 
e_sen25_a_rp13=I have a few.
e_sen25_a_rp13_s=(Navalea) “I can tell you a story about a rebellion against powerful tyrants, treason and loneliness.”<br><br>The werewolves are eager to listen Navalea’s story, probably because they see themselves as warriors in a war against powerful tyrants too.<br><br>The rest of the night passes without incident, and you wake up refreshed. 
e_sen25_a_rp14=Oh! You recognized me?
e_sen25_a_rp14_s=(Wilbur) “I am the great scholar Wilbur, and it is normal that you want me to share my knowledge with you. It is a good chance for me to show you a little essay...”<br><br>The werewolves are confused. They hear concepts like the Wolf Wars mixed with strange words like depreciation, inflation and compound interest.<br><br>Wilbur keeps the werewolves awake until their brains can no longer assimilate new information, but at least you managed to sleep well. 
e_sen25_a_rp15=Hey! That’s a curious rifle you have there.
e_sen25_a_rp15_s=(Nenukil) “Nice weapon, friend. Is it a Forest Stallion Short Canon Revolving Rifle? That’s a relic!”<br><br>The werewolves are aware of Nenukil’s shotgun and quickly understand that he is a weapons expert. Nenukil and the werewolves have a good time talking about weapons maintenance.<br><br>They are grateful for Nenukil’s tips and they share with him the information about the location of a stash where the dryads keep the belongings of the dead adventurers that are lost in the forest. 
e_faen21_b_rp1=Argh... Time to warm up!
e_faen21_b_rp1_s=Grukli prepares his weapons and vigorously charges into the enemy.<br><br>While Grukli is busy slicing enemies right and left, you have time to prepare for helping him in battle.<br><br>Grukli’s passion for battle is contagious!
e_faen21_b_rp2=I expected something like this. 
e_faen21_b_rp2_s=(Bree) “The forest has its laws, and our presence here is against some of them. This is their territory... this is their hunting ground.<br><br>Don’t waste time while they try to intimidate us. Let’s create a defensive area around the bonfire. I can use these spines to fortify it.”<br><br>More and more eyes appear, but thanks to Bree’s instructions, you are prepared to defend against the horde. 
e_faen21_b_rp3=I should have known they would come... 
e_faen21_b_rp3_s=(Sylvie) “Beware these creatures. They are as cute as they are deadly! Many adventurers have died from underestimating them. Wait until you can clearly see the red of their eyes to strike, and remember: they never strike alone. One will bait you while the other two will strike from places you can’t see. Clever cute critters...”<br><br>Thanks to Sylvie's advices you are prepared to counter the enemy tricks, and you will not fall tonight!<br><br>The battle begins shortly after Sylvie has finished talking.
e_faen21_b_rp4=I will burn them all!
e_faen21_b_rp4_s=Cornelius casts some fireballs towards the red eyes. The old man’s accuracy and expertise is something that never fails to surprise you.<br><br>For a moment, his fireballs illuminate the area and you can clearly see your enemies for a while.<br><br>It smells like scorched fur, but at least the cold is gone. 
e_velka9_a1_rp2=Argh... This creature better be a worthy opponent!
e_velka9_a1_rp2_s=Without giving it a second thought, Grukli charges inside the cave, yelling a battle cry at the top of his lungs.<br><br>You join him shortly after. He exchanges blows with the creature, and you can prepare properly for the fight.<br><br>You wonder if this distraction was part of Grukli’s plan or just a side effect of his lust for battle. 
e_velka9_a1_rp2_f=Without giving it a second thought, Grukli charges inside the cave, yelling a battle cry at the top of his lungs.<br><br>When you join him, it seems that he is losing the fight against the creature, but at least Grukli is still on his feet.<br><br>You are sure that this isn’t the outcome that Grukli wanted, but he seems to enjoy it, even with the grave wound that he has suffered.
e_velka9_a1_rp3=Beep... Threat detected. Activating defensive protocols.
e_velka9_a1_rp3_s=The beast reacts to Heiner’s voice and attacks the robot.<br><br>The powerful sentinel braces for impact and is able to resist the beast’s charge.<br><br>Heiner is determined to protect you all, and you know that this beast will have a hard time trying to surpass Heiner's defenses.  
e_velka9_a1_rp4=Oink... I have an idea!
e_velka9_a1_rp4_s=(Ottis) “Oink... Listen to me! That beast feeds on skinny goblins, so I am sure if he sees me his mouth will water! Let’s use that to our advantage! I will bait him... Oink!”<br><br>You are not sure that is a good plan, but Ottis seems determined to take this risk, so you let him go first into the cave.<br><br>Once you hear him screaming, you rush into the cave. The plan worked: The creature is so focused on Ottis that it doesn’t realize that you are there.  
e_velka9_a1_rp4_f=(Ottis) “Oink... Listen to me! That beast feeds on skinny goblins, so I am sure if he sees me his mouth will water! Let’s use that to our advantage! I will bait him... Oink!”<br><br>You are not sure that is a good plan, but Ottis seems determined to take this risk, so you let him go first into the cave.<br><br>Once you hear him screaming, you rush into the cave. The plan worked: The creature is so focused on hitting Ottis that it doesn’t realize that you are there, but it looks like Ottis is injured.
e_velka9_a1_rp5=Hold on. This is the den of something dangerous.
e_velka9_a1_rp5_s=(Andrin) “We could light a bonfire at the entrance of the cave and the smoke would force the creature to rush out.”<br><br>You sharpen your weapons while Andrin prepares the trap. Finally, Andrin baits it by doing some animal whistles.<br><br>Thanks to Andrin's instructions, you are ready and able to attack the creature from all sides once it comes out.
e_velka9_a1_rp5_f=(Andrin) “We could light a bonfire at the entrance of the cave and the smoke would force the creature to rush out.”<br><br>You sharpen your weapons while Andrin prepares the trap. Finally, Andrin baits it by doing some animal whistles.<br><br>The creature, as a native of Velkarath, is prepared to resist the smoke effects and is quite angry at your party. A better ranger would know that. Your ambush didn’t work.
e_velka9_a1_rp6=This is a minotaur’s lair.
e_velka9_a1_rp6_s=(Wilbur) “By this time of the year, the minotaurs spend most of their time preparing for the fighting season, be it eating or fighting. The creature will be extremely aggressive, but its lust for battle makes it predictable...”<br><br>Wilbur speaks for a while, and you learn a lot about how to exploit the creature’s behavior.<br><br>You feel prepared to enter the cave.  
e_velka9_a1_rp6_f=(Wilbur) “At this time of the year, the minotaurs spend most of their time sleeping. The creature will be extremely aggressive only if we wake it up. We can enter without real danger.”<br><br>Wilbur speaks for a while, and you learn a lot about minotaurs before you enter.<br><br>When you enter the cave and face the creature, you realize that Wilbur was mistaken about the minotaurs. That mistake hurts him more than the beast’s horns. 
e_velka9_a1_rp7=Sss... Let me go first. 
e_velka9_a1_rp7_s=(Thuls) “Sss... Follow me closely, and we will take the creature by surprise”<br><br>You follow Thuls into the cave and you are able to get close to the creature without it noticing your presence.<br><br>Thuls gives the signal, and you take the beast by surprise. Thanks to Thuls' skills, the ambush is a success!
e_velka9_a1_rp7_f=(Thuls) “Sss... Follow me closely and we will take the creature by surprise”<br><br>You follow Thuls into the cave, but very soon you realize what a bad idea it is. You are not as skilled in stealth as he is, and the creature sees you all.<br><br>Before you can react, the creature charges and hits Thuls. After the initial chaos, you are ready to fight the minotaur, but Thuls seems injured. 
e_velka9_a2_rp2=Argh... This goblin eater's days are numbered!

e_velka9_a2_rp6_f=rptd_e_velka9_a1_rp6_f

e_velka9_a2_rp7_f=rptd_e_velka9_a1_rp7_f
e_ulmin19_b_nm=The merchant of Ulminin
e_ulmin19_b_dsc=In front of a bust of a big heron, you find a feline merchant boasting about the sacred Basthet’s relics he is selling, blessed by the goddess herself. From her sacred paws to your hands!<br><br>He says that you look like fine connoisseurs of relics and ancient artifacts and that you should take a look at his wares.<br><br>There are some items that catch your eye. 
e_ulmin19_b_dsca=Will you risk being tempted by the merchant?
e_ulmin19_b_rp0=There is something weird here.
e_ulmin19_b_rp0_s=You don’t want anything to do with this merchant.<br><br>This is a strange place for selling his wares and you don’t trust him.<br><br>You resume your journey without further delay.
e_ulmin19_b_rp1=It may be worth a look.
e_ulmin19_b_rp1_s=You inspect his wares closely and you realize that these are just low-quality products. They are not even well made.<br><br>You tell that to the feline merchant, and he offers you some gold if you keep your mouth closed and keep moving. He doesn’t want you to spoil his business!<br><br>You accept the bribe and continue your journey.
e_ulmin19_b_rp1_sc=This is a scam and you are going to take advantage of it.<br><br>You tell the feline that, as famed adventurers, you are going to spread the word about this scam!<br><br>The feline doesn’t even bother defending his wares. He trusts that a little contribution of gold to your cause is enough for you to leave. In silence. It is a generous bag, so you accept it and continue your journey. 
e_ulmin19_b_rp1_f=You can’t believe your luck! Authentic relics from Basthet herself, within your reach and for only a fraction of their worth. He must have lost his mind. You pay him before he decides to reconsider his offer.<br><br>The feline grabs your gold and hands you your new acquisitions.<br><br>By the time you realize that you have overpaid for a bunch of spoons and poorly crafted wares, the merchant is far away.
e_ulmin19_b_rp1_fc=This is your lucky day! If you buy ten items, you only pay for five! You don’t need that many but you will find a use for them later!<br><br>The feline reluctantly grabs your gold while, with great sorrow, he says goodbye to his dear relics.<br><br>The merchant is no longer around when you realize that you have overpaid for a bunch of mundane spoons and poorly crafted wares. You can’t believe you fell for this scam. 
e_ulmin19_b_rp2=I am member of the merchants' guild. Here is my card.
e_ulmin19_b_rp2_s=The feline merchant gets nervous when he sees that your card is authentic.<br><br>He tells you that he doesn’t want any problem with the guild and offers you a donation, as his wares are unworthy of the guild standards.<br><br>He trusts that this pouch will help you to forget all the inconveniences that you may have found in your journeys. 
e_ulmin19_b_rp3=Amusing. This is fake.
e_ulmin19_b_rp3_s=(Navalea) “These relics are fake. Basthet dislikes this kind of ornament. Everybody knows that. And trust me. I know her better than anyone else.”<br><br>Navalea looks at the feline merchant’s eyes, who seconds turns and runs away after some uncomfortable, realizing that he may have offended the wrong person.<br><br>(Navalea) “We can take whatever this liar left behind and resume our journey. I don’t think he will come back anytime soon.”
e_ulmin19_b_rp4=You are mistaken. Please allow me to explain.
e_ulmin19_b_rp4_s=(Wilbur) “I am the great scholar Wilbur, and I am here to be the beacon of knowledge that dispels your ignorance.<br><br>As you can see, this is feline craftsmanship from the western of Ulminin replicating the heron’s solemn style. You can see it if you look at these details...”<br><br>Wilbur speaks for minutes but the feline grows impatient. He offers you a pouch of gold if you leave before new customers arrive.
e_ulmin19_b_rp5=Croak... A long-necked lute!
e_ulmin19_b_rp5_s=Gustav grabs the instrument and when he is about to play it, it falls apart in his hands. You realize that all the items are poorly crafted forgeries.<br><br>The feline merchant quickly offers you some gold if you don’t say anything about his wares and you just forget what happened here. You have to leave before other victims appear!<br><br>You take the pouch and continue your journey. This is the easiest money that Gustav has ever earned with his performances. 
e_ulmin19_b_rp6=I feel a bad mojo about this.
e_ulmin19_b_rp6_s=(Malukah) “You shouldn’t play with things that you don’t understand.<br><br>These fake relics are tainting your mojo. But fear not, for I have the proper potion to clean your soul. A clean mojo is a happy soul and that price is within your paw reach! I have a discount for you.”<br><br>The merchant handles Malukah a pouch of gold in exchange for her potion. Malukah seems happy but is it for the gold or for helping a tainted soul? 
e_ulmin19_b_rp7=This old wolf is not going to fall in that trap.
e_ulmin19_b_rp7_s=(Magnus) “You should be ashamed of this crude scam. What would your elders think of you? Sooner or later, you will find yourself in trouble.”<br><br>The feline merchant offers you a gold pouch if you leave him alone and don’t tell his secret.<br><br>The veteran mercenary understands that you have more urgent matters to attend to. You continue your journey with some extra gold. 
e_ulmin19_b_rp8=A scam involving sacred relics?
e_ulmin19_b_rp8_s=(Reginald) “I know that there is no evil in you, friend.<br><br>I can show you where the righteous path starts, but it is up to you to walk it.”<br><br>The feline speaks with Reginald for a while. After that, you can see in the merchant’s eyes his sincere repentance and he offers you the gold that he obtained by cheating gullible fools with his fake relics. While you are counting your gold, the feline leaves to start a new life. 
e_ulmin19_b_rp9=Sss... It is not worth stealing these wares.
e_ulmin19_b_rp9_s=(Thuls) “Sss... It would be a pity if someone were to spread the word that your relics are fake. I am sure that you understand what I mean, friend, sss...”<br><br>Thuls is playing with one of his knifes while he keeps an eye on the merchant.<br><br>The merchant, powerless against Thuls’ threat, gives him a little pouch of gold and tells him to disappear from his sight. After measuring the pouch's weight, Thuls nod and you resume your journey. 
e_ulmin19_b_rp10=Ha ha ha I can’t believe it! 
e_ulmin19_b_rp10_s=(Yogger) “This is the oldest trick in the book. Give me all the gold that you have and I will forget your attempt to scam me. It’s clear that you don’t know who I am. I will give you a clue: I am someone dangerous with little patience.”<br><br>The merchant gives Yogger a small pouch of gold. Yogger keeps staring at the merchant and the feline gives him another little pouch.<br><br>Yogger seems pleased with the outcome.  
e_ulmin19_b_rp11=This is outrageous!
e_ulmin19_b_rp11_s=(Laia) “You are profaning Basthet name! I order you to stop right now!<br><br>I will confiscate your gold in the name of Basthet’s temple, and you better take the remaining items back to her temple if you want her forgiveness!”<br><br>The feline merchant claims that he sincerely repents and leaves to the west with his wares. Laia is proud that she convinced him to go to the temple, but she doesn’t realize that he is marching in the opposite direction.

e_faen25_a_rp2=I can’t stand this cruelty.
e_faen25_a_rp2_s=Bree charges the big bear and hits it. She is faster than it expects.<br><br>By the time a couple of beavers help the huge bear to stand up, Bree is already in a defensive stance with all her thorns prepared to welcome the bear attacks.<br><br>You join her in battle.
e_faen25_a_rp2_f=Bree charges the big bear, but it is stronger than she expects.<br><br>The bear hits Bree and tosses her aside while it roars.<br><br>A couple of beavers come to support their master's attack as you rush to help the brave Bree.
e_faen25_a_rp3=Harley, prepare to attack!
e_faen25_a_rp3_s=(Sylvie) “This explains the beavers’ behavior! That bear is ordering them to expand and gather more resources for its evil machinations! That ends here!”<br><br>Sylvie releases a precise arrow that hits an exposed part of the menacing bear, while Harley harasses it.<br><br>When you are about to reach the bear, a couple of beavers join him.
e_faen25_a_rp3_f=(Sylvie) “This explains the beavers’ behavior! That bear is ordering them to expand and gather more resources for its evil machinations! That ends here!”<br><br>Sylvie releases an arrow, but it doesn’t hit the big bear. The bear ignores Harley’s attempts to harass him and charges directly towards Sylvie.<br><br>She receives a big hit, and a couple of beavers join the huge bear to finish you.
e_faen25_a_rp4=Yes! This gives me an idea!
e_faen25_a_rp4_s=(Zek) “Those beavers are good workers. They should obey somebody like me, not that silly big bear!”<br><br>Zek casts a spell and, before you can react, a bolt of dark energy hits the big bear, which falls to the ground.<br><br>A couple of beavers help him to stand up, but thanks to Zek’s spell, the advantage is yours.
e_faen25_a_rp4_f=(Zek) “Those beavers are good workers. They should obey somebody like me, not that silly big bear!”<br><br>Zek casts a spell and, before you can react, an explosion of dark energy happens where Zek stands. He accumulates and controls a lot of magic at a fast pace.<br><br>He seems injured, but the worst thing is that the bear and the beavers are now ready to attack you.
e_faen25_a_rp5=It is a crude and effective way of control, but I can do it better.
e_faen25_a_rp5_s=Nezglekt focus his magic on the tyrant bear, which suddenly falls to its knees and grabs its head.<br><br>A couple of beavers come to support their master when you are about to strike.<br><br>The bear roars in agony, and it seems that it is freeing itself from Nezglekt's magic, but for now the advantage is in your side.
e_faen25_a_rp5_f=Nezglekt focus his magic on the tyrant bear but somehow the bear’s mind rejects Nezglekt’s magic.<br><br>Nezglekt is dazed as a result of the failure of his magic, and he is unable to dodge when the bear charges towards him.<br><br>You rush to Nezglekt’s aid, and a couple of beavers join the bear’s side.
e_faen28_a_rp4=I will jump to the other side and prepare a rope for you.
e_faen28_a_rp4_s=(Sylvie) “This rope can help us to cross it faster. I will jump to the other side and prepare a rope for you.”<br><br>Sylvie skilfully jumps to the other side and firmly ties the rope. Thanks to that, you can cross the shallow water before the cold affects you.<br><br>When you get out of it, you find yourselves inside some frozen sewers. The cold is extreme. You must hurry or you will freeze to death.

Once the cargo is ready to be loaded onto your ship, you conveniently "forget" to load some boxes of fish. <br><br>You know the company wouldn't approve of leaving anything behind, but you refuse to take away these people's vital supplies.

Please forgive me for not showing you the proper respect. I have the finest fishing gear for you, at the best price, Master Bernard.”<br><br>Bernard nods slowly.
e_sahti11_a_rp5=I would never harm the Sahti. I want to buy some fishing supplies.
e_sahti11_a_rp5_s=(Old Man): "Sigrun, what are you doing with this group? Looking for adventures again, kid? You'd do well to buy some fishing gear from me. I have the best equipment in the archipelago. I'd rather sell it at a low price than see the COT confiscate it from me because I can't pay their outrageous debt."<br><br>Sigrun nods at the man, and you can see her clench her jaw every time he mentions the COT.
e_sahti11_a_rp6=Bad luck for you, buddy. I’m worse than the COT.
e_sahti11_a_rp6_s=(Yogger) “But you know, I have a soft spot for small, defenseless communities. You see, my friends and I need your supplies. If you give us half of what you owe to the COT, we won’t raze this place to ashes. It’s a good deal.”<br><br>The elder looks at Yogger in fear, understanding that the werewolf would do it without a second thought.<br><br>They gather some supplies for your party, allowing you to continue your journey.
e_sahti12_a_nm=Broom practices
e_sahti12_a_dsc=In this area, a major battle between the pirates and the army had taken place, but it seems that the location now serves a different purpose: as training grounds. <br><br>Some soldiers in navy uniforms are present, and they appear to be sparring with each other using brooms instead of weapons. <br><br>When they notice your approach, they ask if you would like to join them in their sparring match.
e_sahti12_a_dsca=Will you join them?
e_sahti12_a_rp0=We don’t have time for this.
e_sahti12_a_rp0_s=You wish them good luck and continue your journey without further delay.
e_sahti12_a_rp1=It looks like a good idea. Challenge accepted!
e_sahti12_a_rp1_s=They hand you some sparring brooms and you proceed to a mock fight. You are surprised by how well-balanced these brooms are. <br><br>You get used to them in no time and manage to defeat the soldiers. <br><br>The soldiers are grateful for the time spent with you and share some stories and drinks.
e_sahti12_a_rp1_sc=They hand you some sparring brooms and you proceed to a mock fight.

e_sahti12_a_rp1_f=They hand you some sparring brooms and you proceed to a mock fight. <br><br>You are surprised by how well-balanced these brooms are, but what is even more surprising is how well the soldiers handle them! <br><br>They are more accustomed to the brooms than you and beat you with ease.
e_sahti12_a_rp1_fc=They hand you some sparring brooms and you proceed to a mock fight. <br><br>You are surprised by how well-balanced these brooms are, but what is even more surprising is how well the soldiers handle them! <br><br>The soldiers beat you without mercy and leave you with some wounds as a reminder.
e_sahti12_a_rp2=We work for the navy as well. Could you teach us some techniques?
e_sahti12_a_rp2_s=The soldiers salute you in the navy way and advise you to keep your eyes wide open. <br><br>One of the soldiers explains the movements to you while the others fight. He describes the adjustments they made to their fighting style to adapt to the confined space of a ship’s deck. <br><br>It has been an interesting session, and you have learned some techniques that will improve your combat skills.
e_sahti12_a_rp2_sc=The soldiers salute you in the navy way and tell you to keep your eyes wide open. <br><br>One of the soldiers explains the movements to you while the others fight.

e_sahti12_a_rp2_f=The soldiers salute you in the navy way and tell you to keep your eyes wide open. <br><br>One of the soldiers explains the movements to you while the others fight. He describes the adjustments they made to their fighting style to adapt to a ship’s deck. <br><br>However, their teachings are very basic, and you barely learn anything from them.
e_sahti12_a_rp2_fc=The soldiers salute you in the navy way and tell you to keep your eyes wide open. <br><br>One of the soldiers explains the movements to you while the others fight. He describes the changes they had to make to their fighting style to adapt to a ship’s deck. <br><br>They are quite inexperienced, and you don’t learn much from them.
e_sahti12_a_rp3=You practice with that? Let me help you.
e_sahti12_a_rp3_s=Nenukil helps the soldiers assemble better practice weapons and target dummies. <br><br>He insists on the importance of similarly weighted and balanced equipment for effective training. The soldiers are surprised by the number of features the new target dummies have. With a clever use of springs and cogs, the dummies even dodge some hits! <br><br>The soldiers tip the dwarf for his work and wish you generous tides before resuming their training exercises.
e_sahti12_a_rp4=I will teach you how to fight against the fishmen.
e_sahti12_a_rp4_s=(Sigrun): “I swear by my honor that you will learn today how to face the fishmen, for in teaching you, I am helping my people! Ready your weapons!”<br><br>The soldiers are surprised by the intensity of Sigrun’s training, but they are not going to miss the chance to learn how to fight a dangerous foe from an expert warrior like her.<br><br>After fighting for a while, Sigrun is proud of how these soldiers are now properly trained to face the fishmen that threaten the Sahti.
e_sahti12_a_rp5=Let’s see what you’re made of!
e_sahti12_a_rp5_s=These soldiers surely know how to fight, but they are no match for someone of your skill! <br><br>You spar with them for a while, exchanging advice and learning about the particularities of fighting the enemies of these islands. <br><br>You’ve picked up new tricks and are eager to try them in your next battles!
e_sahti12_a_rp5_f=These soldiers surely know how to fight and hit far above their station! <br><br>You spar with them for a while, and even though they share advice with you, you’re too busy just trying to survive these friendly matches. <br><br>You barely learn anything and end up quite battered for future battles.
e_sahti13_a_nm=The self-sufficient surgeon
e_sahti13_a_dsc=The assistant of the military officer in charge of this camp informs you that his commander, a surgeon, is about to operate on himself for an injury sustained in the last battle, as there is no one else in the camp capable of performing such a surgery. <br><br>He mentions that the surgeon commander is the only one who can authorize you to take materials and equipment from the camp’s arsenal. <br><br>Additionally, he notes that if anyone among you has medical knowledge, your help would be greatly appreciated.
e_sahti13_a_dsca=Will you assist the surgeon on his operation?

e_sahti13_a_rp1=We can assist him!

e_sahti13_a_rp1_sc=You decide to support the surgeon by performing auxiliary tasks, ensuring that he has access to everything he needs during the surgery. <br><br>The surgery is a success, and he extracts what he was looking for: part of a bullet. <br><br>The doctor is very grateful and orders the assistant to provide you with access to the arsenal and his personal stash.
e_sahti13_a_rp1_f=You decide to support the surgeon by performing auxiliary tasks, ensuring that he has access to everything he needs during the surgery. <br><br>Unfortunately, the surgery doesn’t go as well as planned. Although the surgeon successfully extracts the part of the bullet he was looking for, he is too exhausted to give the order and grant you access to the arsenal, and he falls unconscious. <br><br>You have wasted so much time here and need to move on before he awakens.
e_sahti13_a_rp1_fc=You decide to support the surgeon by performing auxiliary tasks, ensuring that he has access to everything he needs during the surgery. <br><br>Unfortunately, the surgery doesn’t go as well as planned, and although the surgeon successfully extracts the part of a bullet he was looking for, he is too exhausted to give the order to grant you access to the arsenal and falls unconscious. <br><br>You’re still wondering why he asked for a ‘clam’ in the middle of the surgery... Or was it a clamp? Never mind, you have wasted so much time here and need to move on before he awakens.
e_sahti13_a_rp2=Show us the arsenal. We have our own orders from the admiralty.
e_sahti13_a_rp2_s=The assistant looks at your letter of mark and tells you that you have access to the arsenal tent if you wish. <br><br>While the assistant accompanies you to the arsenal, he tells you not to worry about his master, as he is a capable surgeon. Navy orders are a priority. <br><br>You take a look at the arsenal and prepare to continue.
e_sahti13_a_rp2_sc=The assistant looks at your letter of mark and tells you that you have access to the arsenal tent, if you wish. <br><br>While the assistant accompanies you to the arsenal, he tells you not to worry about his master, as he is a capable surgeon. The navy orders are a priority, as the pirates are on the verge of being defeated! You take a look at the arsenal and prepare to continue. <br><br>The assistant also hands you a small pouch of gold.
e_sahti13_a_rp2_f=The assistant informs you that only the surgeon has the authority to grant access to the arsenal. <br><br>He adds that if you're not planning to assist his master, he doesn't have the authority to expel you from the camp, but you won't be of much use here. He recommends that you go elsewhere where your skills might be more valuable. <br><br>Feeling unwelcome, you decide to leave the camp.
e_sahti13_a_rp2_fc=The assistant informs you that only the surgeon has the authority to grant access to the arsenal. <br><br>He adds that if you're not planning to assist his master, he doesn't have the authority to expel you from the camp, but you won't be of much use here. He suggests that you go elsewhere where your skills might be more valuable, if such a place even exists. <br><br>Feeling unwelcome and unappreciated, you decide to leave the camp.
e_sahti13_a_rp3=Hmm... I can help him with a concoction.
e_sahti13_a_rp3_s=Bernard searches in his bag for a specific potion.<br><br>(Bernard): 'Hmm... This concoction will do. Let’s apply it to the injury, and the pain will be gone... for a while.'<br><br>After spending some minutes inside the tent, Bernard comes out smiling. He reports that the surgery was a success and that the doctor is very grateful. The doctor has granted you access to the arsenal and his personal stash.
e_sahti13_a_rp3_f=(Bernard): "Hmm... This concoction will do. Let’s apply it to the injury, and the pain will be gone... for a while."<br><br>Bernard hands the concoction to the assistant, and shortly after, you start hearing cries of pain from the surgeon's tent. Bernard looks at you and says that he may have mistaken the potion to suppress pain with the potion to intensify sensations.<br><br>He advises you to leave before the surgeon recovers from the effects, as he won’t be in a very good mood.
e_sahti13_a_rp4=I will pray to Basthet for him!
e_sahti13_a_rp4_s=(Laia): “Basthet will hear my prayer, and if she wills, we might be enjoying a delicious fish feast in no time!”<br><br>Laia enters the tent, and after a while, she comes out smiling.<br><br>She tells you that Basthet was in a good mood and answered the prayer swiftly. The surgery was a success, and the doctor granted you access to the arsenal and his personal stash. He also ordered his assistant to cook some delicious fish!”
e_sahti13_a_rp4_f=(Laia): “Basthet will hear my prayer, and if she wills, we may soon be enjoying a delicious fish feast!”<br><br>Laia enters the tent and, after a while, emerges looking sad.<br><br>She tells you that Basthet did not answer and that the doctor refused to hear anything about the Ulminin’s goddess. He ordered her to take her nonsense out of the camp. Worse yet, there will be no fish for Laila today. With heavy hearts, you leave the camp.
e_sahti13_a_rp5=I will protect him from bad mojo.
e_sahti13_a_rp5_s=Malukah enters the tent and, when she comes out, is smiling.<br><br>(Malukah): “The mojo in the tent was really bad, but I was here to clean it. The surgery was a success, and the officer granted us access to the arsenal tent—and to his personal stash, too. This man knows the value of a clean mojo!”<br><br>You move to the arsenal tent and inspect it for anything of interest before resuming your journey.
e_sahti13_a_rp5_f=Malukah enters the tent and, when she comes out, looks angry.<br><br>(Malukah): “The mojo in the tent was really bad, but he didn’t want me to clean it! He didn’t want a witch in the tent while he performed the surgery. In fact, he doesn’t want witches in his camp at all, so he asked us to leave as soon as possible.”<br><br>Malukah walks to the camp gates, and you follow her in silence. It’s better not to upset her now. Nobody wants to become the target of Malukah’s anger!
e_sahti13_a_rp6=My knowledge of human’s anatomy may be useful.
e_sahti13_a_rp6_s=(Nezglekt): “I have foreseen this. I know he will succeed; I have seen it. Allow me to go in and observe how he does it.”<br><br>The assistant, unable to deny Nezglekt’s request, lets him enter the tent. After a while, the prophet emerges, saying that the surgery was a success and that the doctor even explained the procedure to him.<br><br>Nezglekt also mentions that he gave a gift to the doctor, and in return, the doctor granted your group access to the arsenal and his personal stash.
e_sahti13_a_rp6_f=(Nezglekt): “The future here is blurry. Allow me to go in and see how he does it.”<br><br>The assistant, unable to deny Nezglekt’s request, allows him to enter the tent.

However, Nezglekt also says that when he offered a gift to the doctor, the doctor rejected it and asked him to leave the camp.<br><br>Nezglekt notes that, as a group, you will be leaving with him. And so you do.
e_sahti13_a_rp7=Oink... I can help!
e_sahti13_a_rp7_s=(Ottis): “I am a healer! Oink...

e_sahti13_a_rp7_f=(Ottis): “I am a healer! Oink... I can pray to the Light to help him heal.”<br><br>The assistant nods to Ottis, and they enter the tent.<br><br>After a while, Ottis comes out of the tent in a hurry. He tells you that the surgery was a success, but the doctor was not open to letting Ottis use his magic. The doctor is a man of science who doesn’t want anything to do with healing magic and asked Ottis to leave if he was going to use it in the camp. Ottis leaves the camp in sorrow, and you follow him.
e_sahti13_a_rp8=Not the first time I’ve seen this situation. I can help.
e_sahti13_a_rp8_s=Reginald tells the assistant that he has been in similar situations in the past and that he knows the best course of action is to let the surgeon proceed. <br><br>However, he will be by his side in case a steady helping hand is needed. After a while in the tent, Reginald comes out smiling. <br><br>He informs you that the surgery was a success and that the doctor granted you access to the arsenal and his personal stash.

e_sahti13_a_rp8_f=Reginald tells the assistant that he has been in similar situations in the past and knows that the best course of action is to let the surgeon proceed.<br><br>However, he will be by his side in case a steady hand is needed. After a while in the tent, Reginald comes out and informs you that the surgery had some complications, and he had to intervene.<br><br>Although he was able to control the situation, the surgeon is now resting and did not have time to grant you access to the arsenal. Reginald says it will take some time for the surgeon to wake up and asks you to resume your journey.
e_sahti19_a_nm=The crater island
e_sahti19_a_dsc=The geography of this island is unique, dominated by a vast crater that covers most of its area. <br><br>Nearby, you'll find some trees and a streamlet, which can be used to replenish your ship's supplies. <br><br>This is a good spot to rest before continuing your journey, or you might choose to explore the island further.
e_sahti19_a_dsca=What would you like to do?
e_sahti19_a_rp0=Leave as soon as possible.
e_sahti19_a_rp0_s=We don’t have a minute to lose. Let’s carry on.
e_sahti19_a_rp1=We will rest here, near the streamlet.
e_sahti19_a_rp1_s=This part of the island is full of life, with no traces of any nearby settlement. <br><br>You choose a spot with a nice view to sit and relax for a while. After resting and drinking some fresh water, you feel ready to face whatever fate has in store for you. <br><br>With renewed energy, you prepare to continue your journey!
e_sahti19_a_rp2=Let’s explore the crater.
e_sahti19_a_rp2_s=You walk for a while until you reach the center of the crater. It appears that something impacted here, but in the middle of the crater, you only find a rune with a thunderbolt engraved on it. <br><br>While you don’t understand the meaning of the rune, you can’t shake the feeling that there is a connection between you and it. <br><br>Unfortunately, it is too heavy to carry around. As you look around, you come across some shards scattered on the ground.
e_sahti19_a_rp2_sc=You walk for a while until you reach the center of the crater. It appears that something impacted here, but in the middle of the crater, you find only a rune with a thunderbolt engraved on it. <br><br>While you don’t understand the meaning of the rune, you can’t help but feel a strange connection to it. Unfortunately, it's too heavy to carry. <br><br>As you look around, you find plenty of shards scattered about. You take the opportunity to rest a little before moving on.
e_sahti19_a_rp2_f=You walk for a while until you reach the center of the crater. It seems that something impacted here, but there is no trace of what it might have been. <br><br>You search the area for a while, but find nothing especially useful. <br><br>At least you manage to rest a bit before resuming your journey.
e_sahti19_a_rp2_fc=You walk for a while until you reach the center of the crater. It appears that something impacted here, but there’s no trace of what it might have been. <br><br>After searching around for a while, you don’t find anything particularly useful. <br><br>You’ll need to return to your ship before you can rest on the island.
e_sahti19_a_rp3=Hmm... Let me mark a good spot to rest on this island on the map.
e_sahti19_a_rp3_s=(Bernard) “Hmm... Did you know that this island underwent a dramatic change about seventy years ago? The Sahti folk believe that a great warrior was expelled from the heavens after a rebellion, and her landing created this crater. <br><br>Hmm... But between us, it wasn’t a rebellion. She’s too kind for that. I believe it was more of an... accident.”<br><br>You head to the location Bernard mentioned, where you manage to rest and find some shards before continuing on your journey.
e_sahti19_b_nm=The landing zone
e_sahti19_b_dsc=The geography of this island is unique. There is a big crater that covers the majority of the island. <br><br>Sigrun points out the best approach to the island, noting that it is a good place to replenish the ship's supplies. <br><br>She also mentions that she would like to retrieve something from the island, indicating that she knows this place very well.
e_sahti19_b_dsca=Do you accept her request?
e_sahti19_b_rp0=Sorry, Sigrun. We are short of time. We must leave.
e_sahti19_b_rp0_s=Lord Hanshek and the princess are within your grasp, and the mission must continue. <br><br>Sigrun watches with a hint of sadness as the island gradually fades from view on the horizon.
e_sahti19_b_rp1=This is where everything started for me.
e_sahti19_b_rp1_s=(Sigrun) “I barely remember anything before my arrival. The first thing I recall is the current Sahti elder, who was much younger at the time, helping me. Although they tended my wounds and healed my body, my soul still suffers. Why was I rejected? Why did I fall? I used to come here to meditate. I even buried some of the gear I carried when I fell nearby. Come with me; I’ll show you.”<br><br>Sigrun leads you to a rune engraved with a thunderbolt. She explains that she cannot fully read it because she doesn’t remember all the symbols, but they seem familiar to her.<br><br>She then digs up a hidden box and shows you its contents.
e_sahti19_b_rp2=Hmm... Is this where they found you, Sigrun?
e_sahti19_b_rp2_s=Sigrun nods to Bernard, and Bernard begins to speak.<br><br>(Bernard) “Hmm... I remember it like it was yesterday. The young man who found you came running to me, asking for help. What he said didn’t make any sense at first, something about a woman from the sky landing on the island. I was about to give him some potion to calm him down, but I saw the truth in his eyes. My concoctions helped alleviate your pain, but I know they can’t heal everything, Sigrun. Hmm, let’s continue our journey and see where it leads us.”<br><br>You find a nice spot to rest on the island before continuing your journey.
e_sahti20_a_nm=The parrot seller
e_sahti20_a_dsc=On the beach of a small island, you see an old man with a small flock of parrots. As you approach him, he says:<br><br>“Ahoy, friends. As you can see, I am in good company, and you too could be if you buy one of these beauties from me. This has been a good year, and I can sell you a young one for just 400g. Think about it! After all, no sailor worth his title sails without a trusty parrot companion!”<br><br>The parrots laugh at once when the man waves at them, but it is clear that some of them are better trained than others.
e_sahti20_a_dsca=Do you want to buy a parrot?
e_sahti20_a_rp0=You have no pet to train.
e_sahti20_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s

e_sahti20_a_rp2_s=The parrot seller is hesitant at first to say goodbye to one of his parrots but eventually offers you Parley, the most daring of his flock.<br><br>It is clear that this man loves his animals, and you feel great respect for that. However, you can't help but wonder why he breeds them to sell if it is so hard for him to say goodbye.<br><br>You give him 400g and as he hands you Parley, he says, “Take good care of my feathery friend. He’s got a spirit like no other.”
e_sahti20_a_rp2_sc=The parrot seller is hesitant at first to say goodbye to one of his parrots, but in the end, he offers you Parley, the most daring of his flock, for 400g.<br><br>Parley immediately takes to your group, hopping from shoulder to shoulder and squawking happily. It's clear that Parley is friendly and eager to see the world with you.<br><br>Seeing how happy Parley is with you, the seller tells you to take good care of his feathery friend. Moved by the bird's joy, he even refunds you half of what you paid.
e_sahti20_a_rp2_f=The parrot seller talks to you for a while, trying to convince you to buy one of the younger ones, as he says that older parrots tend to be more stubborn.<br><br>It becomes crystal clear that he is speaking the truth when one of the older parrots decides to drop its load on your shoulder.<br><br>Deciding that a young one will be a better choice, you agree with the seller and buy one for 400g. After all, this way you can teach the bird where to properly drop its load!
e_sahti20_a_rp2_fc=The parrot seller talks to you for a while, trying to convince you to buy one of the younger parrots, as he claims older ones tend to be more stubborn. <br><br>You quickly feel that he is trying to scam you, and soon the conversation escalates into an argument.<br><br>The seller eventually asks you to leave before things turn violent. Reluctantly, you agree, not wanting to expose the parrots to what you were about to do.

e_sahti21_a_nm=The Loa’s passage
e_sahti21_a_dsc=You arrive at a cave with impressive carvings on its entrance, depicting several Loa. It appears that the carvings were once painted, but most of the color has faded over time. <br><br>It's now impossible to determine whether the painted sections depicted the feats of the engraved Loas or those of lesser Loas.<br><br>A humid breeze carrying a blend of cinnamon and bitterness emanates from the cave. The cave is the largest you have seen in the area and seems to extend deeper than initially anticipated.
e_sahti21_a_dsca=Do you dare to enter this cave?
e_sahti21_a_rp0=There is something ominous here. Let’s look for another way.
e_sahti21_a_rp0_s=You feel a strong instinct urging you to avoid entering the cave. <br><br>Heeding this feeling, you bypass the cave and continue your journey on the surface.
e_sahti21_a_rp1=This is the place the elder told us about. Let’s go.
e_sahti21_a_rp1_s=The cave, illuminated by bioluminescent plants, exudes an eerie aura.<br><br>The walls are adorned with depictions of the Loa’s deeds, leading you further into the depths. Some of these depictions conceal hidden traps, but thanks to the elder's advice, you manage to navigate through without triggering any of them.<br><br>Upon reaching the other side, you find yourself in a vast underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp2=We don’t have time to lose. Let’s go.
e_sahti21_a_rp2_s=The cave, illuminated by bioluminescent plants, has an eerie aura.<br><br>The walls are adorned with depictions of the Loa’s deeds, guiding you deeper into the cave. Some hidden traps are embedded in the walls, but fortunately, they remain inactive.<br><br>When you reach the other side, you find yourself in a vast underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp2_sc=The cave, illuminated by bioluminescent plants, has an eerie aura.<br><br>On the walls, depictions of the Loa’s deeds lead you deeper into the cave. Although there are hidden traps in the walls, they are already deactivated, allowing you to explore the passage safely. You take extra time to learn a great deal about the Loa from the depictions on the walls.<br><br>When you reach the other side, you find yourself in a vast underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp2_f=On the walls, there are depictions of the Loa’s deeds along the trail that leads you deeper into the cave.<br><br>You fail to notice the hidden traps embedded in the walls, which activate and cause water to flood the corridor. With no choice but to run, you swallow a large amount of water in your haste.<br><br>When you finally catch your breath, you find yourself in a vast underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp2_fc=On the walls, there are depictions of the Loa’s deeds along the trail that leads you deeper into the cave.<br><br>You fail to notice the hidden traps in the walls. The traps activate, and water floods the corridor, blocking the entrances and trapping you all inside for what feels like an eternity.<br><br>You swallow a lot of water and fall unconscious. When you wake up, you find yourself in a vast underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp3=Hmm... I use this passage quite often. Follow me.
e_sahti21_a_rp3_s=As you traverse the eerie passage, Bernard explains that the paintings on the walls depict some of the greater Loa’s deeds. <br><br>He tells you that some of these Loa no longer have many followers, which has caused their power to wane.<br><br>Before Bernard can finish all the stories he wanted to share, you find yourself in a vast underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp4=I was always more interested in the surface, but I know this way.
e_sahti21_a_rp4_s=Sigrun explains that this is a sacred cave for the Sahti, with some traps, but she knows how to avoid them. The walls are painted with the story of how the Loa connected the undersea world with the surface. It is a pity that some of these Loa are barely followed by the younger Sahti. <br><br>She says she feels that the Loa were created to protect something, but she doesn’t remember what.<br><br>In silence, while Sigrun tries to recall, you reach a huge underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp5=I have seen enough world to know that there is a trap here.
e_sahti21_a_rp5_s=Andrin decides to go first and search for traps. <br><br>Fortunately for the group, nothing escapes his keen eye, and he spots various traps hidden in the wall behind some of the Loa’s paintings. He is able to disable the traps, allowing you to resume your journey safely. <br><br>You reach a huge underwater cavern sooner than expected.
e_sahti21_a_rp5_f=Andrin decides to go first and search for traps. <br><br>He finds a trap, but while disabling it, another trap activates, trapping him in a room filled with water and blocking all the entrances. You fear the worst, but when the room opens again, he is alive but unconscious. <br><br>Once he recovers, you continue your journey and reach a huge underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp6=Let me check something. I’ll go first.
e_sahti21_a_rp6_s=Sylvie and Harley explore the passage and discover some traps hidden in the walls behind the Loa’s paintings. <br><br>The traps are no match for Sylvie's skills, and she disarms them with ease. Afterward, you are able to traverse the corridor, admiring the curious images on the walls. <br><br>You reach a huge underwater cavern sooner than you expected.
e_sahti21_a_rp6_f=Sylvie tells Harley to wait outside the passage, as she has a bad feeling about it. <br><br>The elf discovers a trap, but it is too late to react. Sylvie finds herself trapped in a room that is flooding, with the entrances suddenly blocked. You fear the worst, but once the room opens again, she is alive but unconscious. <br><br>Once she recovers, you continue your journey and reach a huge underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp7=Sss... This smells like trap. Let me confirm it.
e_sahti21_a_rp7_s=Thuls’s intuition rarely fails, and this time is no exception. <br><br>He discovers a clever trap mechanism hidden behind the drawings on the wall. The mechanism is disabled in no time, and you are free to traverse the passage. <br><br>You are so engrossed in looking at the drawings on the walls that you don’t realize how deep you are until you reach a huge underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp7_f=Thuls' intuition rarely fails, and this time is no exception. <br><br>Unfortunately, the trap is very well hidden from his senses, and he is unable to detect it before it triggers. The trap consists of blocking the entrances of the passage with hidden rock doors and flooding the area where Thuls is. The saltwater is particularly toxic to him due to his amphibian nature, and he loses consciousness soon after the water reaches him.<br><br>You fear the worst, but when the room opens again, he is alive but unconscious. Once he recovers and you can continue your journey, you reach a huge underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp8=I bet my rifle that there is a trap here. Let me check it.
e_sahti21_a_rp8_s=Nenukil's expertise with rock and his experience as an engineer help him discover a clever trap mechanism hidden in the wall behind the Loa’s paintings. <br><br>The mechanism is easily disarmed by the veteran dwarf, who even takes measures to prevent it from rearming itself, as was the intention of its creators. <br><br>Thanks to Nenukil's safety measures, you are able to enjoy the story of the Loa painted on the wall and reach a huge underwater cavern before you realize it.
e_sahti21_a_rp8_f=Nenukil's expertise with rocks and his experience as an engineer help him discover a clever trap mechanism hidden in the wall behind the Loa’s paintings. <br><br>However, the mechanism itself is a trap within a trap. Once the dwarf realizes it, the passage is blocked and begins to flood. Nenukil tries to arm a device to help him breathe underwater, but he runs out of time before completing it. <br><br>You fear the worst, but when the room opens again, he is alive but unconscious. He holds a strange device in his hands that seems to have helped him breathe for a while. Once he recovers, you continue your journey and reach a huge underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp9=Croak... I am sure there is a trap here! I will find it!
e_sahti21_a_rp9_s=Gustav enters the corridor alone, searching for traps. His intuition proves correct as he discovers a trap hidden behind the images of past Loa’s deeds. <br><br>Thanks to a combination of knowledge and a bit of luck, he successfully disarms the trap. He then calls you all, allowing you to continue your journey. <br><br>Gustav recounts the story of how he disarmed the trap repeatedly, and it feels like it takes an eternity for you to finally reach the huge underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp9_f=Gustav enters the corridor alone, searching for traps, but becomes distracted by the paintings on the walls. They depict the story of the Loa and how they connected the surface with the underwater world. <br><br>Before Gustav can finish examining them, the area floods and the passage is blocked. Due to his amphibious nature, the saltwater is toxic, and Gustav quickly faints. <br><br>You fear the worst, but when the room opens again, you are relieved to find that he is alive but unconscious. Once he recovers and you can continue your journey, you reach a huge underwater cavern.
e_sahti21_a_rp10=I used to come here without telling to the old man, so I know all the traps.
e_sahti21_a_rp10_s=(Sigrun): “This is an important cave for the Sahti. To become an adult, a Sahti must come to this cave and choose a Loa to be their main one. In this cave are carved all the Loas that participated in the creation of these islands. It is a pity that some of the Loas represented here are barely followed by the younger Sahti, and thus their power is fading, along with their history.<br><br>That’s what the Sahti believe, but I think the Loa were made to protect something, though I don’t know what.”<br><br>In silence, while Sigrun thinks about it, you reach a huge underwater cavern. 
e_sahti22_a_nm=The great pirate party
e_sahti22_a_dsc=In this place, there is no animosity. A group of pirates laughs and feasts around a campfire, telling jokes and stories.<br><br>A large pirate welcomes you and assures you that there is no violence on this island.<br><br>You can indulge in various activities here: join the drinking and shanty contests, or participate individually in the wits and insults contest.
e_sahti22_a_dsca=Would you like to participate in any of the events?
e_sahti22_a_rp0=Pirate jokes arrr not that fun... We will continue our journey.
e_sahti22_a_rp0_s=The pirate smiles to you and wish you generous tides. <br><br>You can hear them singing while you are leaving.
e_sahti22_a_rp1=Free drinks? Count us in! We will join the drinking contest!
e_sahti22_a_rp1_s=The pirate smiles, and you follow him to a table where other pirates are already enjoying their drinks. <br><br>You don’t know the rules very well, but there are plenty of jugs ready to be emptied. Better start already!
e_sahti22_a_rp2=A shanty singing contest! We have been practicing for this!
e_sahti22_a_rp2_s=Your performance of the shanty “Through Obelisks We Jump” is great. <br><br>The pirates sing along with you even when they don’t know the song, resulting in a mess of out-of-sync voices, but you all have a great time. <br><br>The pirates voted that you are worth the second prize: a chest of gold!
e_sahti22_a_rp2_sc=Your performance of the shanty "Through Obelisks We Jump" is amazing. <br><br>The pirates sing along with you, thoroughly enjoying every moment. They even ask you to sing it again once you've finished. <br><br>They vote your performance as the best of the night and include it in their hall of fame and your prize goes acording to such honor: A chest full of gold and shards!
e_sahti22_a_rp2_f=Your performance of the shanty “Through Obelisks We Jump” is poor. It is clear that someone has been skipping the practices!<br><br>The pirates boo you and they barely let the song finish.<br><br>You are not surprised when the pirates voted you as almost the worst performance of the night.
e_sahti22_a_rp2_fc=Your performance of the shanty "Through Obelisks We Jump" is a catastrophe. <br><br>Not only is your singing horrendous, but it also ruins the mood for the rest of the party. Some pirates decide to pack their things and leave. <br><br>Those who remain vote your performance as the worst of the century and ask you to leave, preferring to be left alone with their sorrow.
e_sahti22_a_rp3=You are more useless than a paper anchor!
e_sahti22_a_rp3_s=The judges of the contest are pleased with Andrin jokes and they love his nautical reference. <br><br>They give him a solid eight out of ten.<br><br>Andrin is happy with the results and accepts his prize with grace.
e_sahti22_a_rp4=What is the pirate’s favorite hobby?
e_sahti22_a_rp4_s=(Bree) “Garrrdening.”<br><br>There is a division among the judges, as some laugh at the top of their lungs while others keep a serious face. They give Bree a seven out of ten and tell her not to spread that rumor. They are tough guys with a reputation to keep! <br><br>Bree gladly accepts her mark and her prize, promising to keep their secret if they are nice.
e_sahti22_a_rp5=How do pirates prefer to communicate?
e_sahti22_a_rp5_s=(Cornelius) “Aye to aye!”<br><br>The judges love it. It is clear that the old man retains a lot of charisma from his youth. They give him an eight out of ten.<br><br>Cornelius receives his prize while yelling at the top of his lungs that he has won and laughing maniacally.
e_sahti22_a_rp6=As elementalist I don’t get to many invitations to parties...
e_sahti22_a_rp6_s=(Evelyn) “Because they say I always start heated arguments.” <br><br>Evelyn accompanies her statement with a mischievous gaze and a small flame on her hand. The judges say that love her performance but you don’t know if they are honest or just scared. They give her a six out of ten. <br><br>Evelyn gets her prize but before leaving she snaps her fingers and a small spark appears on the judges’ table. It seems Evelyn is not pleased with her mark.
e_sahti22_a_rp7=Arg... A dwarf never gets lost.
e_sahti22_a_rp7_s=(Grukli) “We always know our way down!”<br><br>The judges don’t seem to understand the joke and out of frustration Grukli tries to explain it. They tell him that if the joke needs explanation, it is not a good one and give him a three out of ten.<br><br>Grukli sends the judges to hell and goes fishing without getting his award.
e_sahti22_a_rp8=Croak... Oh! I know this! You fight like a dairy farmer!
e_sahti22_a_rp8_s=The pirate judges answer at the same time: How appropriate, you fight like a cow.<br><br>They all laugh soundly. The judges are surprised that Gustav knows the classics and the legendary answer. The tell him that nobody used it since the times of that guy famous pirate. <br><br>Of course, they give him a ten out of ten and an honorific title. Gustav and the pirates have a blast when Gustav receives his prize and the party becomes even nosier than before!
e_sahti22_a_rp9=Beep... Activating joking protocol.
e_sahti22_a_rp9_s=(Heiner) “01110100 01101000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01110100 01101000 01100101 00100000 01100110 01110101 01101110 01101110 01101001 01100101 01110011 01110100 00100000 01101010 01101111 01101011 01100101 00100000 01111001 01101111 01110101 00100000 01110111 01101001 01101100 01101100 00100000 01100101 01110110 01100101 01110010 00100000 01110010 01100101 01100001 01100100”<br><br>The pirate judges look confused. It is clear that they didn’t get it. They give Heiner a zero out of ten. <br><br>Heiner receives his participation trophy and proudly stores it in a safe compartment.
e_sahti22_a_rp10=You know, we felines always get our way.
e_sahti22_a_rp10_s=(Laia) “We are very purr-suasive!”<br><br>The judges laugh and tell her that she is right, but this is a fact, not a joke or a clever insult so they give her a six out of ten. <br><br>Laia thanks Basthet for the prize and ask her to grant the pirates more knowledge for better understand her jokes in the future. She doesn’t seem very happy with the qualification but she forgets about It when she sees that there are free roasted fish in abundance.
e_sahti22_a_rp11=They say that I am a werewolf with no friends.
e_sahti22_a_rp11_s=(Magnus) “I guess that I am... a lone wolf.” <br><br>The judges laugh, but probably more because they didn’t expect the gentleman Magnus to be capable of such a humorous occurrence than for the joke itself. They give him a five out of ten.<br><br>Magnus receives his prize with honor and wastes no time going to the part where the food is. A good mercenary always takes the chance to fill his belly, after all!<br><br>But unfortunately, the drinks seem a bit strong for him!
e_sahti22_a_rp12=Why did the voodoo doll break up with its partner?
e_sahti22_a_rp12_s=(Malukah) “Because they felt a little “pinned” down in the relationship!”<br><br>The judges smile nervously at Malukah. It is clear that they fear the power of a voodoo witch. They give her an eight out of ten. <br><br>Malukah gets her prize and asks for a little token for her snake. The pirates fulfil her request as soon as they can. With Malukah happy, everybody is happy at the party!
e_sahti22_a_rp13=Are you sure I am the person for this?
e_sahti22_a_rp13_s=(Navalea) “Because the only jokes I know are the killing ones.”<br><br>The judges look at each other, not really knowing what to do or say, as they wish to keep this contest within the regulations of the code for all audiences. Since there are some little pirate kids in the audience, they decide to skip Navalea’s joke.<br><br>Nonetheless, she receives a participation trophy and free access to the food area.
e_sahti22_a_rp14=You have less future than a crab in a pot.
e_sahti22_a_rp14_s=The judges burst into laughter at that answer. They tell Nezglekt that he has understood the spirit of the contest and give him a 9 out of 10. Extra points for his outfit in this performance! The squid style is trendy this season!<br><br>Nezglekt receives his prize and, in exchange, offers some gifts to the judges, but they reject them. They don’t need bait for their fishing rods!<br><br>You enjoy the free food area for a while before leaving.
e_sahti22_a_rp15=Oink! I can’t think of anything.
e_sahti22_a_rp15_s=(Ottis) “I am a little ham-strung!”<br><br>The judges laugh at the occurrence of the pigman. Ottis takes some time to realise that he made a joke, and he laughs as well when he gets it. The judges give him a solid seven out of ten. <br><br>Ottis is happy to receive a prize and wears his blue ribbon with pride!
e_sahti22_a_rp16=This reminds me why I become a wandering cleric.
e_sahti22_a_rp16_s=(Reginald) “They kicked me from the temple for putting ladders everywhere. I only wanted to take my prayers to higher levels.”<br><br>The judges barely laugh at Reginald’s joke, but they appreciate his effort. They give him a five out of ten.<br><br>Reginald is happy to receive that mark, for after all, he has a reputation for being serious and boring. This proves that he is on the verge of being funny!
e_sahti22_a_rp17=Prepare to be lectured.
e_sahti22_a_rp17_s=(Sylvie) “I am going to teach you... the elf-abet.”<br><br>The judges smile, and some of them find Sylvie’s innocent joke cute. But they have to be tough with Sylvie’s score, so she will put in more effort in the next contest. They give her a four out of ten.<br><br>Sylvie is not pleased and collects her prize while Harley drops her "load" on one of the judge’s heads. She has always preferred physical humor.
e_sahti22_a_rp18=Sss... They say that I am great at my work...
e_sahti22_a_rp18_s=(Thuls) “That is because I am... a cold-blooded killer.” <br><br>The judges laugh at this one. Not only is the joke good, but the tone in which Thuls delivers it is very appropriate. They give him a seven out of ten. <br><br>Thuls is reasonably pleased, and for a moment, in his eyes, you can see that he has envisioned a future with fewer kills and more jokes. But as quickly as it comes, that spark disappears from his eyes. Maybe in another world, there's a funny Thuls, but it won't happen here.
e_sahti22_a_rp19=Forty-two!
e_sahti22_a_rp19_s=The judges look confused, but before they have time to react, Wilbur proceeds to explain why his answer is not only the proper one for this contest, but also how everything in this universe can be reduced down to his answer. <br><br>The gnome takes a lot of time on stage explaining it, and some judges fall asleep, while others follow his explanations very closely. <br><br>Unfortunately, there is no time to give him a qualification or enjoy the free food, as you need to leave with the next tide.
e_sahti22_a_rp20=They say that I am the best chef.
e_sahti22_a_rp20_s=(Yogger) “That is because my cook is fang-tastic.” <br><br>The judges laugh at Yogger’s occurrence and you can even hear the rumbling of the stomach of some of them. It is clear that they want to finish this soon and go to the free food area! They give Yogger a six out of ten. <br><br>Yogger doesn’t really care much about the score he receives, and he even encourages the judges to move to the place where the food is. He moves there before anyone else. He is a free spirit! And a savage drinker!
e_sahti22_a_rp21=What has 8 legs, 8 arms, and 8 eyes?
e_sahti22_a_rp21_s=(Zek) “8 pirates! Give me my prize.”<br><br>The judges don’t laugh at all. They even lecture Zek about how this is an old pirate trope that has been stigmatizing the pirate society for years and how there are pirates out there with all their limbs perfectly functional. It seems that this is a serious topic for the pirates, and they even disqualify Zek for being inappropriate. <br><br>Zek can’t believe what he is hearing and moves to the free food area. It is easier to think about what you have done with a full stomach.
e_sahti22_a_rp22=I have lived all my life surrounded by dangerous materials and I never had time for a date.
e_sahti22_a_rp22_s=(Nenukil) “I couldn’t find a match!”<br><br>Being used to fuses and matches, the pirate judges love this joke! It helps that most of them are single and available, too. They give him an eight out of ten. <br><br>Nenukil receives his prize and proudly attaches it to his gun. He doesn’t know how long this piece of junk will last hanging from the side of his rifle, but he wants to showcase it as proof of his superior skill and wits!
e_sahti22_a_rp23=You ask me why my hair looks so fierce in battle?
e_sahti22_a_rp23_s=(Sigrun) “It is for my battle braid!”<br><br>The judges know Sigrun very well, as some of them have faced her in the past. One of them even tells the tale of how he was defeated by the Valkyrie’s battle braid! The others agree that the braid is a powerful weapon in her arsenal. They give her a seven out of ten.<br><br>The Valkyrie accepts the prize and tells the pirates that she is going to return it to the Sahti from whom this piece was stolen.
e_sahti22_a_rp24=Hmm... My auntie got married with a giraffe man.
e_sahti22_a_rp24_s=(Bernard) “My cousin got a turtle- neck!”<br><br>The judges laugh at Bernard’s joke. It seems that some of them know his cousin! But even though most of the judges are on good terms with Bernard, as he has saved them more than once, they have to be fair (for a pirate) with the scores, and give him a six out of ten. <br><br>Bernard tells the pirates that his sight is not as good as it used to be and he can’t read the mark well, just like he can’t read what’s written on the potions he gives to wounded pirates. It turns out it was a nine, not a six.
e_sahti22_a_rp25=Why did the aristocrat buy a ladder?
e_sahti22_a_rp25_s=(Amelia) “To reach the high society. It is funny. You may laugh.”<br><br>The judges of the contest look perplexed and qualify Amelia’s joke with a five out of ten. <br><br>The queen accepts her prize and marches with regal demeanor.
e_sahti23_a_nm=The hot springs
e_sahti23_a_dsc=When you enter the building, a gentle receptionist flanked by a couple of guards informs you that this is a no-violence area. Everybody is welcome at Lady Zhi’s hot springs, where problems stay outside. You can enjoy the full hot springs experience for just 400g, as long as you don’t cause any trouble.<br><br>In this area, you find people from all walks of life: pirates, COT officers, natives, and free merchants.<br><br>It is a good place to rest, do some business, or listen to interesting stories.
e_sahti23_a_dsca=Would you like to enjoy the services of the hot springs?
e_sahti23_a_rp0=We don’t have time to enjoy this.
e_sahti23_a_rp0_s=You are sure that you would enjoy your time here but time is on the essence. You continue your journey without wasting more time.
e_sahti23_a_rp1=We have a great reputation as adventurers. Why don’t you host us for just 100g?
e_sahti23_a_rp1_s=The receptionist seems to consider your proposal for a while. On the one hand, news that a group of seasoned adventurers rested here could be very good for business, but on the other hand, you are asking for a significant discount.<br><br>She tells you that she can offer you a one-time deal for that price, just for you, which includes a taste of all the services the hot springs offer, so you can tell other adventurers how wonderful it is!<br><br>The package is a bit rushed, and you don’t have much time to rest, but you enjoy the experience nonetheless.
e_sahti23_a_rp1_sc=The receptionist seems to consider your proposal for a while.

e_sahti23_a_rp3=You show your letter of mark to the receptionist.
e_sahti23_a_rp3_s=(Receptionist): “Are you looking for that famous armorsmith who disappeared in the storm? If so, we have a special deal with the navy for those working on that operation.

It’s a good moment to continue your adventures!
e_sahti23_a_rp5_f=Before the receptionist can agree with him, Gustav starts playing his lute!<br><br>Unfortunately for you, the clients are looking for a quiet place and do not react well to Gustav's aggressive lute plucking. <br><br>The receptionist invites you to leave the premises as soon as possible, and some security staff members gently escort you to the exit.
e_sahti23_a_rp6=Sss... I am a partner in crime, quite literally, of Lady Zhi in Aquarfall.
e_sahti23_a_rp6_s=The receptionist gives a sinister smile to Thuls. She thanks him for his service and tells him that he and his friends can use the facilities for free.<br><br>(Receptionist): “Lady Zhi is very pleased with how her deals are going in Aquarfall.

e_sahti24_a_nm=The nautical machine
e_sahti24_a_dsc=A group of pirates is sacking what appears to be a strange boat, half-submerged in the sea.<br><br>The boat, constructed from metal and glass, resembles an advanced prototype of a ship designed to go underwater. It is painted in the colors of the navy’s admiralty.<br><br>Smoke is emanating from it, suggesting it may not be functioning as intended. The crew of this vessel may be in danger, and it seems the pirates are preparing to flee.
e_sahti24_a_dsca=Will you get close and take a look?
e_sahti24_a_rp0=Whatever it is, it's not our problem. Let's ignore it.
e_sahti24_a_rp0_s=You don’t know what is happening here, and it may be something dangerous. <br><br>You decide to ignore it and carry on. <br><br>After all, the princess isn’t going to rescue herself!
e_sahti24_a_rp1=We must get close to help!
e_sahti24_a_rp1_s=The pirates flee when they see you approaching; it seems they’ve already gotten what they wanted. <br><br>As you get closer, you notice that the nautical machine is damaged, with water leaking inside, but you might have time to inspect it if you’re quick.

e_sahti24_b_nm=The White Demon
e_sahti24_b_dsc=You see in the distance a flagless ship chasing a big white whale. They seem to be in the process of hunting the creature.<br><br>Whales, besides being majestic animals, are revered by the people of these islands, so not even the COT dares to hunt them.<br><br>The white whale is struggling with its chasers and is fleeing in your direction, faster than you expected.
e_sahti24_b_dsca=How do you react?

e_sahti24_b_rp0_s=You have time to maneuver and avoid the whale.<br><br>The ship hunting the whale is too busy to send you a nautical salute, but you don’t give it a second thought and continue your journey.
e_sahti24_b_rp1=We have to help the whale!
e_sahti24_b_rp1_s=You move your ship to intercede between the whale and the whalers. <br><br>The maneuver is a success, and the whalers can't avoid crashing into your ship, entangling both vessels. <br><br>Unfortunately, the whalers' ship is attached to a harpoon that is deeply embedded in the whale's side.

e_sahti24_b_rp2_s=You don’t want to share your future trophy and decide to attack the whalers before focusing your attention on the whale. <br><br>They are aware of your maneuver and ram your ship with theirs, but your ship withstands the impact! <br><br>The ships are entangled with the harpoon and ropes linked to the whale, and you are forced to fight while the powerful animal drags you underwater.

e_sahti25_a_nm=Storming the fortress
e_sahti25_a_dsc=This is the famous pirate Whitebeard's fortress, but it seems the pirates decided to retreat to the sea as the navy forces got closer. <br><br>The fortress is huge, and without a doubt, it is full of traps. But the rewards may be worth the risk. <br><br>The navy troops will storm the fortress very soon, but you can take advantage of your superior mobility and loot it before they arrive.
e_sahti25_a_dsca=Would you like to explore the fortress?
e_sahti25_a_rp0=rptd_e_sahti12_a_rp0
e_sahti25_a_rp0_s=We have to rescue the princess. Let the navy take care of the fortress. <br><br>Let’s carry on.
e_sahti25_a_rp1=Let’s loot the treasure chamber!
e_sahti25_a_rp1_s=The treasure chamber is going to be the most well-protected area for sure, but also the one with the best loot! <br><br>Whitebeard and his crew are very successful pirates, so it is highly improbable that they were able to take all their treasure with them. <br><br>It’s easy to find where they store their loot, and very soon, you are at the gates of a big vault.
e_sahti25_a_rp2=Let’s take a look at the arsenal.
e_sahti25_a_rp2_s=The pirates may have left some weapons behind, so it might be a good chance to add new tools to your arsenal. <br><br>Navigating the fortress is quite intuitive for you, and you reach the arsenal without further complications, where you find a lot of rusty weapons and spare parts. <br><br>There is a heavy iron gate that divides the arsenal, and you can see some better-looking weapons through its bars.
e_sahti25_a_rp3=Let’s search for some supplies in the storehouse.
e_sahti25_a_rp3_s=If you’ve learned anything during all this time navigating, it’s that there are never enough supplies, so you decide to search for the storage area. <br><br>The fortress is well-organized, and you find where they keep the supplies in no time. The kitchen is also nearby, as well as the infirmary. <br><br>This is definitely the right place to look for supplies.
e_sahti25_a1_nm=The treasure chamber
e_sahti25_a1_dsc=The room is full of empty chests, and there is a door that divides the vault, but the keyhole of the door has been sabotaged, so you’re sure the pirates have hidden something interesting on the other side.<br><br>There are some nice paintings showing a captain with a white beard at different moments in his life. Your adventurer senses are tingling.<br><br>You have a feeling that there must be a trap, but you can’t see it.
e_sahti25_a1_dsca=How do you solve this?
e_sahti25_a1_rp0=rptd_e_sahti12_a_rp0
e_sahti25_a1_rp0_s=On second thought, you don’t have time for this. The pirates sabotaged it to make their pursuers waste time trying to open it. <br><br>You’re not going to give them that satisfaction.
e_sahti25_a1_rp1=The key is in the paintings. Let’s investigate them.
e_sahti25_a1_rp1_s=The paintings on the wall seem to represent Whitebeard in different phases of his life. <br><br>In the picture depicting the stage of his life when he is appointed as the great captain of the pirates, there is a hidden key on his belt. <br><br>You push it, and the door opens, granting you clear access to the treasures in the next room.
e_sahti25_a1_rp1_sc=The paintings on the wall seem to represent Whitebeard in different phases of his life.<br><br>In the picture depicting Whitebeard having a feast with his crew, you notice a hidden key on his cravat.<br><br>You push it, and the door opens, granting you clear access to the treasures in the next room.

e_sahti25_a1_rp1_fc=The paintings on the wall seem to represent Whitebeard in different phases of his life. <br><br>In the picture depicting the stage of his life when he captured his first prey, there is a hidden key on his jacket. <br><br>You push it, and poisonous darts shoot from the walls, poisoning you and spoiling the rest of the paintings, making it impossible to find the right one.
e_sahti25_a1_rp2=This door is not enough to stop us. Let’s break it.
e_sahti25_a1_rp2_s=You muster all your strength and push the door. Several times. <br><br>Finally, you open it, and the treasure room is all yours. <br><br>You know what they say: brute strength—if it’s not working, you’re not using enough.

e_sahti25_a1_rp2_f=You muster all your strength and push the door. Several times. <br><br>You are unable to open it and end your attempt before anyone gets hurt. <br><br>Brute strength is always the solution... What could have gone wrong?
e_sahti25_a1_rp2_fc=You muster all your strength and push the door. Several times. <br><br>You are unable to open it, and you stop your attempt after getting hurt. <br><br>Brute strength is always the solution... What could have gone wrong?
e_sahti25_a1_rp3=I will use my magic to solve this.
e_sahti25_a1_rp3_s=It is easy for you to identify and track the magical energies that link the pictures on the wall.<br><br>The paintings depict moments from the life of the pirate captain Whitebeard, and it seems they hold the key to accessing the treasure without triggering any traps.<br><br>Thanks to your magic, you identify the correct picture where Whitebeard's cravat hides a key. Pushing it opens the door to the vault.
e_sahti25_a1_rp3_f=It’s easy for you to identify and track the magical energies that link the pictures on the wall. The paintings depict moments from the life of the pirate captain Whitebeard, and it seems they hold the key to accessing the treasure without triggering any traps. <br><br>Thanks to your magic, you’re certain that a key hidden in Whitebeard’s jacket in one of the pictures is the right one. You press it without hesitation, only to have poisonous darts shoot out from the walls. <br><br>The darts hit you, and in the chaos, they also spoil the rest of the paintings, making it impossible to find the right one.
e_sahti25_a2_nm=The pirate’s arsenal
e_sahti25_a2_dsc=In the pirate’s arsenal, there are several weapons racks that have seen better days. <br><br>What lies behind a big iron gate seems to be in better condition. <br><br>The chain that served to open the iron gate is broken. You could look for another way to open it or try using brute strength.
e_sahti25_a2_dsca=rptd_e_sahti19_a_dsca
e_sahti25_a2_rp0=rptd_e_sahti12_a_rp0
e_sahti25_a2_rp0_s=On second thought, you don’t have time for this. The pirates sabotaged it to make their pursuers waste time trying to open it, and you’re not going to give them that pleasure!<br><br>Besides, pirate weaponry isn’t that good after all.<br><br>You search through the rusty weapons for something useful before leaving, but you don’t find anything.
e_sahti25_a2_rp1=Let’s look for some tool to lift the gate.
e_sahti25_a2_rp1_s=You look around and decide to use the rusty weapons and spare parts to assemble a tool to help you. <br><br>With a little skill, time, and luck, you manage to create a lever that might be strong enough to lift the gate. <br><br>Your lever works, and as long as you don’t hit it, it should hold the door up!
e_sahti25_a2_rp1_sc=You look around and decide to use the rusty weapons and spare parts to assemble a tool to help you. <br><br>With a little skill, time, and luck, you manage to create a lever that is strong enough to lift the gate. <br><br>Your lever, a pinnacle of craftsmanship, works wonders and can hold the door up as long as you need!
e_sahti25_a2_rp1_f=You look around and decide to use the rusty weapons and spare parts to assemble a tool to help you. <br><br>With a little skill, time, and luck, you manage to create a lever that turns out to be an absolute failure. <br><br>As expected, your lever doesn’t work, but at least no one was injured.
e_sahti25_a2_rp1_fc=You look around and decide to use the rusty weapons and spare parts to assemble a tool to help you. <br><br>With a little skill, time, and luck, you hope the lever you create won’t be an absolute failure. <br><br>Unfortunately, your lever turns out to be a failure, and when the door crushes it, its parts fly around like shrapnel, wounding you.
e_sahti25_a2_rp2=This door is not enough to stop us. We can lift it!

You feel powerful!
e_sahti25_a2_rp2_f=You muster all your strength and lift the door. <br><br>You’re unable to keep it high enough to cross, and you stop your attempt before anyone gets hurt. <br><br>Brute strength is always the solution... What could have gone wrong?
e_sahti25_a2_rp2_fc=You muster all your strength and lift the door. Several times.<br><br>You’re unable to keep it open, and you stop your attempt after getting hurt. <br><br>Brute strength is always the solution... What could have gone wrong?
e_sahti25_a2_rp3=I can lift that door.
e_sahti25_a2_rp3_s=You’ve lifted heavier weights in your training! You lift the door with ease and hold it while the rest of the group scrambles to find a way to keep it lifted. <br><br>They take too long, but with a final push, you lift the door high enough for it to stay up on its own. Now, you can access the arsenal freely. <br><br>As the old saying goes: if brute strength isn’t working, you’re not using enough. You feel powerful!
e_sahti25_a2_rp3_f=You’ve lifted heavier weights in your training! You lift the door for a moment, but it’s heavier than you expected, and you can’t hold it long enough for the rest of the group to pass.<br><br>You try again, and again, and again, but each time, the door doesn’t stay open. You overextend yourself and end up injuring yourself.<br><br>The secrets that lie behind that door will remain hidden from you.
e_sahti25_a3_nm=The pirate’s warehouse
e_sahti25_a3_dsc=The warehouse, kitchen, infirmary, and archives are within your reach. They’re probably not as well-stocked as they were when the pirates lived here, but there should still be something useful.<br><br>It looks like the pirates abandoned this area last, as the kitchen, infirmary, and archives are open and show signs of use. Only the warehouse door is closed.<br><br>The navy troops are already in the fortress, so you may only have time to investigate one of these rooms before they claim it for the admiralty.
e_sahti25_a3_dsca=Which room would you like to check?
e_sahti25_a3_rp0=In a second thought, we don’t have time for this.
e_sahti25_a3_rp0_s=Your mission is important, and time is of the essence. <br><br>After all, your ship is well-supplied, and overloading it will only slow her down. <br><br>You decide to return to your ship as fast as you can.
e_sahti25_a3_rp1=Let’s check the warehouse!
e_sahti25_a3_rp1_s=You manage to open the warehouse door with little effort. <br><br>Inside, you find plenty of supplies for your ship—canvas, tar, planks, and some tools too. <br><br>The pirates left behind useful materials, and you wonder if this means their ships are full of treasure or just really well-stocked, with these being the surplus.
e_sahti25_a3_rp1_sc=You manage to open the warehouse door with little effort. <br><br>Inside, you find plenty of supplies for your ship—canvas, tar, planks, and some tools too. <br><br>The warehouse is well nurtured and you have plenty to choose. It seems that the pirates indeed left the fortress in a hurry, as the supplies you find here are plentiful and of high quality.
e_sahti25_a3_rp1_f=The warehouse is protected by a humble wooden door that looks quite frail. <br><br>Although you’re convinced it will be easy to open, your attempts fail, and after a while, you decide to continue your journey before anyone gets hurt by the unopenable door. <br><br>Sometimes things are more than they seem!
e_sahti25_a3_rp1_fc=The warehouse is protected by a humble wooden door that looks quite frail. <br><br>Although you’re convinced it will be easy to open, your attempts fail. After trying everything that crossed your mind, you decide to opt for the secret weapon: shouting at it. No enemy can stand against a good battle cry, least of all a humble wooden door! <br><br>Unfortunately, a couple of navy officers discover you shouting at the door and, worse still, failing in your attempts to open it. Feeling embarrassed by your performance, you leave without saying a word to the officers.

e_sahti25_a3_rp2_s=The pirates of this fortress knew a thing or two about the importance of a good meal, and in the kitchen, you find lots of ingredients to prepare a great feast. <br><br>You’re not going to let good food go to waste, so you prepare a lavish meal to your liking. <br><br>It’s a pity that you can’t save anything for later. <br><br>You continue your journey with renewed energy.

e_sahti25_a3_rp4=Let’s check the archive where they store the nautical logs.
e_sahti25_a3_rp4_s=It’s clear that the pirates destroyed the most recent nautical logs from the archive, as you only find old ones. However, one log in particular catches your eye. <br><br>This log details the search for a wreck in which a well-reputed artisan, an expert in trinkets, was lost. The story quickly turned into a legend, and there’s an attached shanty about the artisan’s skills in the log. The lyrics say that the artisan is calling other artisans to practice their craftsmanship together for all eternity. <br><br>The log entry ends with an order written in capital letters instructing the crew to avoid the shipwreck in the storm.

e_sahti32_a_rp2_s=(Sigrun): “The sahti told me the story of this ship. Its captain was Halfman. It is said that he was invincible and wore every scar his enemies caused him with pride.

e_sahti33_a_rp2_s=You sing along with the mermaids, accompanying and complementing their chorus.

e_sahti48_a_nm=The phasmid
e_sahti48_a_dsc=A long strand of grass-like algae catches your eye, and, for some reason, you find it intimidating.<br><br>Something strange is going on here, but you can’t quite put your finger on it.<br><br>You’ve never seen this type of algae growing at such depths, and it sparks your curiosity.
e_sahti48_a_dsca=Will you get close to check them?
e_sahti48_a_rp0=We don’t have time for a bunch of algae. Let’s carry on.
e_sahti48_a_rp0_s=As much as these algae are looking menacing to you, you don’t have time for this. <br><br>You are not going to be bullied by a bunch of underwater plants.
e_sahti48_a_rp1=Let’s pick up some samples.
e_sahti48_a_rp1_s=The algae loom ominously as you approach to take a sample. You hope that picking it won't trigger whatever it might have in store for you.<br><br>You grab a handful of algae and... nothing happens. The result is disappointing; by this point, you were expecting something extraordinary to occur.<br><br>It turns out to be nothing more than a bunch of weird-looking algae.
e_sahti48_a_rp1_sc=The algae loom ominously as you approach to take a sample, hoping that doing so won’t trigger whatever danger they might hold. You grab a handful of algae and... nothing happens.<br><br>It seems these algae attract and poison their prey, but you are not to their taste. Fortunately, as you notice from the remains of their former victims scattered nearby, the algae have some connection to shards—the victims are filled with shard-like material. <br><br>You collect these shards before continuing on your way.
e_sahti48_a_rp1_f=The algae loom ominously as you approach to pick a sample, hoping that doing so won't trigger whatever danger they might hold.<br><br>You grab a handful of algae, and suddenly, they release a flurry of tiny stingers! You don’t have time to react, and some of them hit you.<br><br>You feel a wave of nausea and dizziness, but it's nothing severe enough to stop you from continuing your journey.
e_sahti48_a_rp1_fc=The algae loom ominously as you approach to pick a sample, hoping that doing so won’t trigger whatever danger they might hold.<br><br>As you grab a handful of algae, it suddenly unleashes a barrage of tiny poisoned stingers! You don’t have time to dodge them, and some of the stingers hit you.<br><br>A wave of nausea and dizziness washes over you. Before you can remove the stingers, a group of creatures emerges from the algae and ambushes you!
e_sahti48_a_rp2=Let’s investigate it.
e_sahti48_a_rp2_s=You decide to keep a safe distance from the dangerous algae and examine it from afar. Just as you're about to leave, you witness the algae in action as a small creature ventures too close.<br><br>The algae shoot hundreds of tiny stingers at the unfortunate creature, which quickly succumbs and is pulled into the mass of algae.<br><br>This experience teaches you a valuable lesson: always keep a safe distance from strange-looking algae.
e_sahti48_a_rp2_sc=You decide to keep a safe distance from the dangerous algae and observe it from afar.<br><br>Just as you're about to leave, you're fortunate enough to witness the algae in action as a small creature wanders too close. The algae shoot hundreds of tiny stingers at the unfortunate creature, which falls into the algae and is never seen again, transforming into shards!<br><br>You wait a bit longer, then retrieve some shards, gaining valuable experience and discovering a natural shard generator.
e_sahti48_a_rp2_f=You decide to keep a safe distance from the dangerous algae and observe them cautiously.<br><br>Nothing happens the entire time you watch, leaving you with a sense of disappointment as if your time has been wasted.<br><br>You leave with a lingering feeling that these algae harbor a mystery you're unable to uncover.
e_sahti48_a_rp2_fc=You decide to keep a safe distance from the dangerous algae, observing it cautiously. However, after a long period with no activity, you decide to move closer for a more detailed inspection before leaving.<br><br>Suddenly, the algae shoot hundreds of tiny stingers at you, giving you no time to evade.<br><br>A wave of nausea and dizziness overwhelms you. Before you can remove the stingers, a group of creatures emerges from the algae and ambushes you!
e_sahti48_a_rp3=Hmm... interesting. This phasmid colony is growing strong.
e_sahti48_a_rp3_s=(Bernard): “These algae are known as phasmid, and they have a very interesting particularity. They immobilize their victims by attacking with hundreds of small poisoned stingers, then desiccate them. The acids they use to kill their prey eventually solidify, resembling magical shards. However, their effect is not as potent as the ones we typically use. Hmm... I believe they are called the shards of the fools.”<br><br>Bernard points out some of these fake shard replicas and shows you the remains of the phasmid colony’s victims.<br><br>Bernard stores some of the algae's poison in a couple of flasks.
e_sahti48_a_rp4=Sss... I know a good poison when I see it!
e_sahti48_a_rp4_s=Thuls grabs an empty flask from his belt and slowly rubs his hand knife on the algae's surface.<br><br>(Thuls): “Sss... Do you see that viscous liquid? It's magnificent! I've never seen a poison so concentrated. I should explore the underseas more often.”<br><br>While Thuls is busy filling some flasks with the algae poison, you gather some shards from the area.
e_sahti48_a_rp5=I am sure that algae can be used as poison.
e_sahti48_a_rp5_s=Andrin grabs an empty flask from his belt and slowly rubs his hand knife on the algae's surface.<br><br>(Andrin): “It is quite easy to extract it, really. It reminds me some algae that grows in the lakes of Senenthia. I used to harvest it when I was a child and hide it on my brother’s shoes.”<br><br>While Andrin is smiling telling stories about how he tried to bully his older brother, the rest of the group gathers some shards from the area.
e_sahti48_a_rp5_f=Andrin grabs an empty flask from his belt and slowly rubs his hand knife on the algae's surface.<br><br>(Andrin): “It is quite easy to extract it, really. It reminds me kind of algae that grows in the lakes of Senenthia. I used to harvest it when I was a child...”<br><br>Before Andrin could finish his story, the algae react to his presence and spits all its poisonous content to Andrin’s face, poisoning him.
e_sahti48_a_rp6=Croak... I will try to gather some poison from that algae.
e_sahti48_a_rp6_s=With care, Gustav grabs an empty flask from his belt and slowly rubs his knife on the algae’s surface.<br><br>(Gustav): “Croak... It is very easy to do this! I used to do the same with some Aquarfall lichen, but this poison seems far more powerful!”<br><br>While Gustav finishes filling his flasks, the rest of the group gathers some shards from the area. 
e_sahti48_a_rp6_f=With care, Gustav grabs an empty flask from his belt and slowly rubs his knife on the algae’s surface.<br><br>(Gustav): “Croak... It is very easy to do this!

e_sahti48_a_rp7=The poison from that algae will work wonders on my arrows.
e_sahti48_a_rp7_s=With care, Sylvie grabs an empty flask from her belt and slowly rubs her knife on the algae’s surface.<br><br>(Sylvie): “Doesn’t it bring back memories, Harley? We used to gather some poisonous moss from trees in Faeborg Forest. This algae seems far more powerful than the moss from home!”<br><br>While Sylvie finishes filling her flasks, the rest of the group gathers some shards from the area.
e_sahti48_a_rp7_f=With care, Sylvie grabs an empty flask from her belt and slowly rubs her knife on the algae’s surface.<br><br>(Sylvie): “Doesn’t it bring back memories, Harley? We used to...”<br><br>Before Sylvie can finish talking, the algae react to her presence and spit all their poisonous content into her face, poisoning her. Fortunately, Harley is able to avoid the poison, and her squawk draws your attention to the elf. You all hurry to help Sylvie and leave the place as soon as she can move.
e_sahti48_a_rp8=I will try to gather some poison from that algae.
e_sahti48_a_rp8_s=With care, Nenukil grabs an empty flask from his belt and slowly rubs his knife on the algae’s surface.<br><br>(Nenukil): “Ha ha, it is very easy to do this. Not the first time I’ve rubbed a rock to get some strange poison, you know? Back in my day, I experimented with adding some poisonous mushroom reagent to my bullets, but this one seems far more powerful!”<br><br>While Nenukil finishes filling his flasks, the rest of the group gathers some shards from the area.
e_sahti48_a_rp8_f=With care, Nenukil grabs an empty flask from his belt and slowly rubs his knife on the algae’s surface.<br><br>(Nenukil): “Ha ha, it is very easy to do this.

You all hurry to help him and leave the place as soon as Nenukil can move.
e_sahti48_b_nm=The whispering cave
e_sahti48_b_dsc=You find yourselves in a large undersea cavern. <br><br>A plethora of bioluminescent plants light the cave, allowing you to navigate without issue. <br><br>For now, you can only hear the sound of water drops hitting the ground, but your adventurer instincts tell you that the kraken was not the most dangerous inhabitant of this place.
e_sahti48_b_dsca=What do you want to do in this eerie corridor?
e_sahti48_b_rp0=There is a princess waiting to be rescued. Let’s move.
e_sahti48_b_rp0_s=Even though the group is exhausted, there’s no time to rest. Who knows what ordeal the princess might be suffering?<br><br>Surely there will be dangers ahead, but you have the skill to overcome them.<br><br>You won’t let a few drops of water echoing through these walls drive you crazy!
e_sahti48_b_rp1=Let's listen to that spooky, weird sound for a moment.
e_sahti48_b_rp1_s=All of you fall silent for a while, quietly listening to the noise. <br><br>At some point, you recognize the sound of a creature. It's clear that some creatures are preparing an ambush very close by! <br><br>You identify their location, and with a signal, your fury descends upon them!
e_sahti48_b_rp1_sc=All of you fall silent for a while, quietly listening to the noise. <br><br>At some point, you recognize the sound of a creature.

e_sahti48_b_rp1_f=All of you fall silent for a while, quietly listening to the noise. <br><br>At some point, you hear what sounds like a creature. It's clear that you're not alone, but you don't know the creature's intentions.<br><br>You adopt a defensive formation, and after a while of waiting, the creatures finally attack.
e_sahti48_b_rp1_fc=All of you fall silent for a while, quietly listening to the noise. <br><br>After a while of hearing nothing but the drip of water, you decide to continue your journey. <br><br>Shortly after, just before you can leave the corridor, a group of creatures ambushes you!
e_sahti48_b_rp2=Only one of us can benefit from this invigorating magic.
e_sahti48_b_rp2_s=You focus all your attention on the dense magic emanating from the bioluminescent plants and notice how breathing near them makes you feel a warm sensation. You feel energized!
e_sahti48_b_rp2_f=Your chest burns and you are unable to control the dense magic, so it falls under the control of another teammate.
e_sahti48_b_rp3=Those echoes... Silence, let me hear them.
e_sahti48_b_rp3_s=The group goes silent for a while, and you feel your chest fill with a burning, energized sensation. <br><br>But before you can dwell on it, you clearly hear a group of creatures hiding nearby, waiting to ambush you as you pass. <br><br>You signal the rest of the group, and as the veteran adventurers that you are, no words are needed in these circumstances. The group attacks the ambushers before they have time to react!
e_sahti48_b_rp3_f=The group goes silent for a while, and you can clearly hear it: an unending drip of water in these corridors, always at the same pace. If you keep focusing on it, you’re going to lose your mind.<br><br>You tell the group that you can continue without problems, just as a group of enemies jumps out of the shadows to ambush you!<br><br>The rest of the team is busy fighting the creatures, but you can’t stop thinking about how this basic ambush slipped past your senses. You feel really bad about it!
e_sahti48_b_rp4=Before we continue, let me examinate this magic.
e_sahti48_b_rp4_s=You focus on the nature of the magic and discover something interesting. <br><br>These energies are in conflict, as if the native magic of this place is trying to repel something unnatural. It is not the kind of magical energy you would expect from a place like this. <br><br>You also discover that this mixture of energies creates excellent quality shards, and you find some samples in small holes in the cavern’s walls. After being exposed to these energies, you feel an invigorating sensation burning inside your chest.
e_sahti48_b_rp4_f=You focus on the nature of the magic, but the energies in this area are too chaotic to work with.<br><br>Deciding to forget it, you continue your journey.<br><br>When the rest of the group asks what happened, you simply tell them it was nothing important. Deep down, however, you feel you have failed them as a mage.
e_sahti48_b_rp5=Wait a minute, I am feeling something I thought forgotten.
e_sahti48_b_rp5_s=Sigrun stops her march and closes her eyes, sensing the dense magical energies in the corridor. <br><br>You watch as she breathes it in, and after a while, she suddenly opens her eyes, her chest burning. She assures you that she’s fine and ready to continue, but she now feels a strange, fiery energy inside her. <br><br>You notice that the dense magic that was floating in the corridor is no longer visible—it seems she absorbed all of it.
e_sahti48_b_rp5_f=Sigrun stops her march and closes her eyes, trying to sense the dense magical energies in the corridor. <br><br>She seems to be struggling to concentrate as the energies swirl agitatedly around her. <br><br>Just as the energies begin to stabilize, a group of enemies ambushes you, dispersing the magic and forcing you to adopt a defensive stance!
e_sahti49_a_nm=The undersea facility
e_sahti49_a_dsc=You arrive at what looks like a research facility, consisting of a big crystal dome surrounded by smaller ones. The purpose of the smaller domes seems to be the study of different biomes undersea, while the big middle dome serves as a control room. <br><br>The place seems abandoned, as debris impedes easy access to the domes, and who knows what dangers you may find inside. <br><br>However, perhaps the scientists left something interesting behind, either in the different biome domes or in the central one.
e_sahti49_a_dsca=Would you take the risk to explore it?
e_sahti49_a_rp0=We'd better not take this risk. Let's continue our journey.
e_sahti49_a_rp0_s=You decide it's better to leave this place alone. Who knows what creatures call it home now?
e_sahti49_a_rp1=Their most interesting discoveries would likely be in the main dome.
e_sahti49_a_rp1_s=You make your way through the debris to reach the main dome, and what you find there leaves you speechless. <br><br>Ghostly echoes of scientists conduct their research on several exotic artifacts in the middle of the room, ignoring your presence. Each time you blink, the scene seems to reset, and a new set of scientists appears. Each of you seems to see a different group of scientists. <br><br>You grab some artifacts and leave as soon as you can.

Each time you blink, the scene seems to reset and a new set of scientists appears. Sometimes even unspeakable horrors appear, but they disappear as quickly as they come. That’s enough to make you decide to leave this place as soon as possible.<br><br>Once you are out of the dome, you feel that there is something you don’t remember, but you can’t wrap your head around it, so you continue your journey not knowing what you don’t know.
e_sahti49_a_rp1_fc=You make your way to the main dome through the debris, and what you find there leaves you speechless.<br><br>Ghostly echoes of scientists conduct their research on several exotic artifacts in the middle of the room, ignoring your presence. Each time you blink, the scene seems to reset, and unspeakable horrors appear and disappear as quickly as they come. You can hear the silent screams for help from the scientists. You have to leave this place before you lose your mind.<br><br>You don’t know what happened here and you can’t think clearly, as the echoes of the scientists’ panicked screams reverberate in your mind.
e_sahti49_a_rp2=A dome replicating a desert underseas? Let’s go!
e_sahti49_a_rp2_s=The door is blocked by a lot of desert sand, so you break the glass and create a new entrance.<br><br>The breach in the glass allows heat to escape from the dome, causing the temperature to drop rapidly.<br><br>Thanks to your meticulous search, you find a stash of items in this artificial desert!
e_sahti49_a_rp2_sc=The door is blocked by a lot of desert sand, so you break the glass and create a new access. <br><br>The breach in the glass allows heat to escape from the dome, causing the temperature to drop rapidly.<br><br>In the center of the dome, partially buried in sand, you discover a stash of items and a bunch of shards!

e_sahti49_a_rp3=Let’s investigate the mountainous dome!
e_sahti49_a_rp3_s=When you try to open the gate of the mountainous dome, something seems to be blocking the entrance, so you break the dome's crystal, creating a new opening. <br><br>It's evident they took this project seriously, as there are numerous mineral formations within the dome.<br><br>You search for the most promising ones and you find a stash of useful items, probably used for the experiments here.

e_sahti49_a_rp3_fc=As you attempt to open the gate of the mountainous dome, something obstructs the entrance. You decide to break the dome's crystal, creating a new opening. <br><br>It's clear they took this project seriously, as several creatures exclusive to the mountains now inhabit the dome.<br><br>Suddenly, you find yourselves surrounded and forced to defend yourselves!
e_sahti49_a_rp4=Let’s explore the dome replicating a frozen region.
e_sahti49_a_rp4_s=You can feel the cold from the other side of the dome. The door is frozen and stuck, but you manage to open it without further damage. <br><br>Once it opens, a wave of cold air hits you. You step into the dome and feel an intense chill that quickly goes from refreshing to unbearable. <br><br>Although there are signs of life in the dome, not a single creature disturbs you and you can inspect a nearby stash of items.

The door is frozen and stuck, but you manage to open it.<br><br>Unfortunately, what you thought was a thick snow layer is actually a thin ice layer over a small frozen lake. By the time you realize this, it's too late, and the ice breaks under your weight.<br><br>To make things worse, a group of native creatures, attracted by the noise, attacks you without hesitation!
e_sahti49_a_rp5=That murky swamp dome must hide something interesting. Let’s check it out.
e_sahti49_a_rp5_s=The door to the swamp dome is sticky, but you manage to open it without any problems. <br><br>The smell of stagnant water is dizzying and so intense that you can practically feel the air teeming with life. <br><br>Unsure of how safe it is to stay here for too long, you quickly search in a nearby item stash and leave as fast as you can.
e_sahti49_a_rp5_sc=The door to the swamp dome is sticky but you open it without problems. <br><br>The smell of stagnant water is dizzy and so intense that you even feel the air full of life.<br><br>A chest half submerged catches your eye and when you open it, you find some items and notes about this experiment: It seems that they were testing the degradation of this equipment in such environment.

e_sahti49_a_rp6_s=The dome that serves as a dock for the submarines appears abandoned, with the only sign of recent activity being the submarine that brought you down here, still docked at the pier. It waits for a land crew that will likely never come to complete its landing maneuver.<br><br>You were on that boat not long ago, but now, you have the chance to inspect and loot it safely, so you decide to give it a try.<br><br>You finish the nautical machine's landing operation and, once inside, discover that its pantries are stocked with rations in good condition. You take what you can and leave as quickly as possible.

e_sahti4_a_dsc=In the hall of the fortress housing the navy admiralty, you encounter an army officer who explains the situation in the archipelago. <br><br>He details how the navy aims to assist the island's denizens, but the Company of Overseas Trade is urging a swift resolution to pirate activities so that traditional trade routes can be reopened. <br><br>The admiralty is seeking corsairs to aid the army and is even offering a small sloop along with a letter of marque.
e_sahti4_a_dsca=Are you willing to work as corsairs for the navy?
e_sahti4_a_rp0=It would be better if we sneak onto one of their ships.
e_sahti4_a_rp0_s=You inform the officer that you are not interested and head to the docks. With so many ships coming and going, finding one to sneak onto shouldn't be too difficult.<br><br>You board a navy ship that is about to depart, and soon after it weighs anchor, the boatswain discovers you.<br><br>He adds your names to the crew list as cabin boys, and you begin your duties as the ship sails towards the horizon.
e_sahti4_a_rp1=We will serve as corsairs under the navy's flag.
e_sahti4_a_rp1_s=You inform the officer of your decision to pledge loyalty to the admiralty.<br><br>Pleased with your choice, the officer administers your oath, and upon completion, he presents you with a letter of marque and permission to take command of a navy sloop.<br><br>Upon arriving at the dock, you find your ship fully supplied and ready to set sail in pursuit of pirates.
e_sahti4_a_rp2=We would like to buy one of the ships at your dock for 500g.
e_sahti4_a_rp2_s=Your mission to rescue the princess is imperative, and you cannot afford to submit to military discipline.<br><br>The officer understands your position and expresses his respect for your commitment to the cause.<br><br>He assists you with arrangements to hire a small sloop, fully supplied and ready to sail.
e_sahti51_a_nm=The loa columns
e_sahti51_a_dsc=You find a group of finely carved totems representing what looks like some important undersea Loas. <br><br>Most of the totems are in good condition, and you can recognize their shape, but three of them are far more deteriorated. <br><br>Near the base of the totems, there are some tools and materials, but they are in such bad condition that you are sure they won’t last more than one use.
e_sahti51_a_dsca=Would you like to repair one of the totems?
e_sahti51_a_rp0=rptd_e_sahti12_a_rp0
e_sahti51_a_rp0_s=You are in a hurry and for what you have heard about the Loa, they may not react well if you only repair one of the statues and leave the other two unattended. <br><br>You leave.
e_sahti51_a_rp1=Let’s repair the one that looks like a crab.
e_sahti51_a_rp1_s=After you finish repairing the totem, a valiant voice speaks from it and tells you that the crab is a devoted protector of the sea bottom. <br><br>He is the tireless cleaner of the sea who doesn’t hesitate to get his claws dirty if it means a better future for the inhabitants of the sea. In stepping forward and getting your hands dirty rebuilding this totem, you have proven yourselves to be in tune with the crab's teachings! <br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the crab.
e_sahti51_a_rp1_sc=After you finish repairing the crab totem, a valiant voice speaks from it and tells you the story of the crab. <br><br>The crab is the protector of the sea bottom and his task is to keep it clean, not only physically but spiritually too. A mere cleaner as he may be, over time, he has learned that sometimes you can repurpose what you are supposed to destroy to your advantage, in order to build a brighter future, for, in the end, that is all that matters. <br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the crab.
e_sahti51_a_rp1_f=You repair the totem but it barely has the form of anything. You may just create a new abstract modern art category but nothing happens once you give it the final touch. Probably for the best. <br><br>After contemplating your piece of art for a while, you decide to continue your journey, leaving your work here as a gift for the future generations.
e_sahti51_a_rp1_fc=You repair the totem but it barely has the form of anything. You may just create a new abstract modern art category but nothing happens once you give it the final touch.

e_sahti51_a_rp2=Let’s repair the one that looks like an octopus.
e_sahti51_a_rp2_s=After you finish repairing the octopus totem, a guttural voice speaks from it and tells you that the octopus must always be smart and patient in order to survive.<br><br>He must stay one step ahead of his adversaries and strike mercilessly once they are within his reach. <br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the octopus.
e_sahti51_a_rp2_sc=After you finish repairing the octopus totem, a guttural voice speaks from it and tells you the story of the octopus. <br><br>He doesn’t have the sharpest teeth or is the fastest swimmer, but he has the biggest brain and knows how to use it: Hide, be patient, and wait until your enemies make a mistake. Then, strike from where they least expect it and finish them with a tight grab. Give them time to realize the fatal mistake they made in underestimating you. In the end, they will learn that you were always in control, and that is all that matters. <br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the octopus.

e_sahti51_a_rp3_sc=After you finish repairing the dolphin totem, a gentle voice speaks from it and tells you the story of the dolphin. <br><br>He explains that when he realized how the Loa’s mischievousness could harm the good people of the archipelago, he made it his mission to help those affected. <br><br>Over time, he learned that helping others is the perfect way to spread kindness, and in the end, that is all that matters. <br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the dolphin.

e_sahti52_a_nm=The old shell
e_sahti52_a_dsc=In this place, a turtle man is napping in front of a huge shell that seems to be his home.<br><br>He rests in a hammock near a carefully cultivated garden of exotic seaweeds. Even though you don't know much about these particular seaweeds, it's clear they require a lot of work and knowledge to flourish like that. You wonder how useful they might be for your mission.<br><br>You could wake him and ask if he can spare some, or you could try to gather them quietly without disturbing the old creature.
e_sahti52_a_dsca=Will you awaken the old turtle man from his peaceful sleep to ask for his help, or will you risk taking from his precious garden without his knowledge?
e_sahti52_a_rp0=This turtle man is taking a nap, let’s leave without disturbing him.
e_sahti52_a_rp0_s=You understand that sleeping in the hammock is almost sacred, so you decide not to disturb the turtle man's sleep. <br><br>You're not that kind of monster. <br><br>You leave quietly, careful not to make any noise, and with a promise in your heart that once you complete your mission, you'll have a glorious nap in a hammock too.
e_sahti52_a_rp1=Let’s ask him nicely for some help.
e_sahti52_a_rp1_s=You awaken the turtle man, and to your surprise, he doesn’t seem upset. In fact, he is very kind.<br><br>He introduces himself as Bernard, an alchemist, and explains that his garden hosts some marvelous and strange seaweeds, excellent for alchemy.<br><br>When you tell him about your mission, he shares that he used to be an adventurer too, once on a quest to find the philosopher's stone. Now, however, he rarely leaves his home, but you reminded him of his adventuring days, and he is so pleased that he offers you some supplies at a good price.
e_sahti52_a_rp2=We are here on behalf of the Sahti people. They need help.
e_sahti52_a_rp2_s=The turtle man jumps from his hammock and tells you that he will send help to the Sahti at once. <br><br>He was expecting something like this to happen and has a good provision of the seaweed that the Sahti need. He tells you that you have done a great service to the Sahti people, as they are the true soul of these islands, and he wishes you the best of luck before leaving to prepare the package for the Sahti. <br><br>You feel good for helping the Sahti and fulfilling your duty as adventurers. You continue your journey with your heads held high.
e_sahti52_a_rp3=Let’s try to steal something useful.
e_sahti52_a_rp3_s=The turtle man is old and sleeping soundly. You easily take some of the seaweeds that you know may benefit you in the future. <br><br>There are some exotic seaweeds that you could sell for a good amount of gold, but since you don’t know if it’s safe to pick them, you decide to stick to the ones you recognize. Once you have a handful, it's time for you to leave. These algae are worth a nice sum of gold. <br><br>It’s not that you fear the reaction of the turtle man, but it would be better for everyone involved if he doesn’t catch you with your hands dirty.
e_sahti52_a_rp3_sc=The turtle man is old and sleeping soundly. You easily take some of the seaweeds that you know may benefit you in the future. <br><br>There are some exotic seaweeds that you could sell for a good amount of gold, as you know that some of these algae were quite popular some time ago and were bought at high prices by nobles from all over the world. Just a handful of these algae are worth a nice sum of gold! <br><br>You leave once you have enough. It would be better for everyone involved if the turtle man doesn’t catch you with your hands dirty.
e_sahti52_a_rp3_f=The turtle man is old and sleeping soundly, but you manage to awaken him while trying to get some seaweeds. <br><br>The turtle man is scared at first, but once you explain why you are doing it, you see the look of disappointment in his eyes. At this moment, you realize that it would have been better to awaken him and directly ask for his help. <br><br>Now, with all the sorrow and shame you feel, your only option is to leave without looking directly at the turtle man.
e_sahti52_a_rp3_fc=The turtle man is old and sleeping soundly, but you wake him with your screams of agony. <br><br>It happens that you stepped on the part of his garden where he is nurturing poisonous algae, and the seaweeds reacted to your presence. He rushes to aid you and treats your wounds, but while doing so, you have to listen to him lecture you about how stealing from others is wrong. <br><br>He lets you leave, but you still feel the effects of the poison and fear that it may affect you in the future.
e_sahti52_a_rp4=I know him. He is a good friend.
e_sahti52_a_rp4_s=Sigrun gets close to the sleeping turtle man and awakens him. He is glad to see her and she introduces him as Bernard, the best alchemist in this side of the world to the rest of the group. <br><br>Bernard is a little embarrassed for such words and tells you that she is very kind and any friend of Sigrun is welcome at his home. <br><br>After you explain him your mission, Bernard offers you some supplies and wish you good luck with your journey. He says that he would love to go with you but for now he must stay home, as he fears that the obelisk influence may affect the Loa and the islands balance.
e_sahti52_a_rp5=This is Bernard, he can help us to save the Sahti.
e_sahti52_a_rp5_s=(Sigrun): “Bernard! The elder needs your help. The disease is spreading fast. He sent us to look for you.” <br><br>The turtle man awakens and jumps from his hammock with a skill you definitely were not expecting. He and Sigrun talk for a while, and then Bernard proceeds to prepare the seaweeds that the Sahti need. He apologizes to you as he has a lot of work to do and doesn’t have time to invite you for some tea. <br><br>Sigrun tells you not to be fooled by his appearance, as he is the best alchemist on this side of the world. He is reliable, and you can continue your journey knowing that the Sahti will be saved.
e_sahti52_b_nm=Undersea roads, take me home
e_sahti52_b_dsc=Bernard tells you that this big shell is his home. <br><br>He explains that his garden of exotic seaweeds is mostly innocuous, but he implores you not to step over his plants. <br><br>He tells you how much he loves to nap in his hammock, but since you don’t have time for a little nap, you may take some algae from his private stock to help you in your mission.
e_sahti52_b_dsca=Will you accept his offer and take some algae?
e_sahti52_b_rp0=We don’t have time for this, Bernard, let’s keep moving.
e_sahti52_b_rp0_s=Bernard looks sad and confused, as he doesn’t understand why you won’t stop here since he really wanted to. <br><br>But the mission comes first, and you continue your journey.
e_sahti52_b_rp1=You really don’t mind giving us something from your beautiful garden?
e_sahti52_b_rp1_s=(Bernard): “Hmm... Don’t worry. You are my allies, and these algae were planted to help people in need. I believe they may serve us well.” <br><br>Bernard prepares a handful of seaweeds and packs them in a pouch. He claims that these are an experimental breed and they may serve you well in the future. <br><br>You wonder how they may serve you, but the turtle man tells you that it is time to continue.
e_sahti52_b_rp2=Give me a moment to prepare the medicine that the Sahti people need.
e_sahti52_b_rp2_s=It seems that Bernard is prepared for this contingency, as he has stored a great amount of the seaweed that the Sahti people need. <br><br>He loads a couple of sacks with the algae and orders his magical octopus pet to carry them to the Sahti village. Bernard assures you that the pet will complete the mission and that you are free to continue, knowing that the Sahti village is saved. <br><br>Bernard also shows you a pouch and tells you that if his hypothesis is right, it will serve you soon.
e_sahti52_b_rp3=It’s been a long time since I last visited your house, Bernard.
e_sahti52_b_rp3_s=(Bernard): “Hmm... You came here not so long ago, my dear Sigrun. Is your memory failing you again? Wait here. Let me get something for you.” <br><br>Bernard disappears into his house and shortly after appears with a couple of little pouches. He hands one to Sigrun and shows you the other. <br><br>(Bernard): “Hmm... That one will help you with your memory, Sigrun. Take it three times a day. This one will serve us if my hypothesis is correct. Let’s continue to the obelisk.”
e_sahti56_a_nm=The lost shipment
e_sahti56_a_dsc=Some pirates are busy looting a place full of boxes and packages, seemingly unaware of your presence. <br><br>You can barely make out the symbol on the crates, but it appears to be an old version of the COT seal. <br><br>It's unclear how this load ended up here, but if it contains anything valuable, those pirates will get to it before you have the chance!
e_sahti56_a_dsca=Will you attempt to claim the contents of the cargo?
e_sahti56_a_rp0=It is not worth the effort.
e_sahti56_a_rp0_s=The pirates have already taken a strong defensive position near the cargo, and you're unsure if more of them are hidden, so you decide it's not worth the risk. <br><br>Besides, the obelisk is nearby, and you can feel yourself drawing closer to Lord Hanshek and the princess! <br><br>There's no time to lose!
e_sahti56_a_rp1=Hey you rascals, that cargo belongs to the COT!
e_sahti56_a_rp1_s=The pirates are surprised when you appear with official COT documents. <br><br>While some of them approach you menacingly, others hang back, whispering among themselves. Just as the fight is about to start, those at the back flee, clearly unwilling to face problems with the COT, leave the supplies alone and flee. <br><br>The remaining pirates attack you, but now they are at a clear disadvantage.
e_sahti56_a_rp2=Let’s charge at them!
e_sahti56_a_rp2_s=The pirates are busy looting the place, so it's best to attack now! <br><br>You charge at them with everything you've got, taking care not to destroy the supplies in the process. They barely have time to brace for impact.<br><br>The pirates were probably expecting company at some point, but clearly not as formidable as you! Overcoming their defenses is easy for you.
e_sahti56_a_rp2_sc=The pirates are busy gathering the loot, so it's the perfect time to attack! <br><br>You charge at them with everything you've got, taking care not to destroy the supplies in the process. They barely have time to brace for impact.<br><br>Overwhelmed by your formidable performance, the pirates' defenses quickly crumble before you!
e_sahti56_a_rp2_f=The pirates are busy looting the place, so it's best to attack now! You charge at them with everything you've got, but these veteran pirates are prepared. <br><br>A hidden sentry raises the alarm as you approach, and the other pirates try to destroy the supplies. <br><br>However, thanks to your swift charge, they don’t have time to destroy them all.
e_sahti56_a_rp2_fc=The pirates are busy looting the place, so it’s the perfect time to attack! You charge at them with everything you’ve got, but these veteran pirates are prepared. <br><br>A hidden sentry raises the alarm as you approach, and the other pirates try to destroy the supplies. <br><br>Reacting instinctively, they quickly dispose of most of the supply crates and counterattack, disorganizing your strike and leaving you vulnerable to their assault!
e_sahti56_a_rp3=Let’s wait for them to finish looting before attacking.
e_sahti56_a_rp3_s=You hide and patiently wait for the pirates to finish looting the place. Only when it looks like they are preparing to leave do you make your move. <br><br>The pirates are still adopting their traveling formation when you strike, ensuring the supplies remain safe from the impending battle.<br><br>Laden with heavy burdens and disorganized, they have no way to counter your ambush, and the fight quickly turns in your favor.
e_sahti56_a_rp3_sc=You hide and patiently wait for the pirates to finish looting the place. Only when it appears they are preparing to leave do you make your move. <br><br>The pirates are still adopting their traveling formation when you strike, ensuring the supplies remain safe from the impending battle.<br><br>Some of them flee in panic, quickly turning the fight in your favor.
e_sahti56_a_rp3_f=You hide and patiently wait for the pirates to finish looting the place. Only when it appears they are preparing to leave do you make your move. <br><br>The pirates are still arranging their traveling formation when you strike, causing some of the supplies to be lost in the chaos of the upcoming fight. Though burdened with heavy loads, they remain far from disorganized.<br><br>This isn’t the first ambush they’ve faced, and it’s up to you to make sure it’s their last!
e_sahti56_a_rp3_fc=You hide and patiently wait for the pirates to finish looting the place. Only when it appears they are preparing to leave do you make your move. <br><br>Suddenly, a hidden sentry spots you and raises the alarm. <br><br>Reacting instinctively, they quickly dispose of most of the supply crates and counterattack, disorganizing your strike and leaving you vulnerable to their assault!
e_sahti56_a_rp4=They look like scavengers, not like warriors. Let’s intimidate them.
e_sahti56_a_rp4_s=You approach the pirates, making your best effort to look intimidating, and to your surprise, it works! <br><br>They are open to hearing what you have to say. Negotiating with pirates is rarely a good idea, but this time you made it work. <br><br>They agree to share some of the gold and supplies from the loot with you!
e_sahti56_a_rp4_sc=You approach the pirates, making your best effort to look intimidating, and to your surprise, it works! <br><br>They are open to hearing what you have to say. Who can deny anything to a gang as good-looking as yours? Negotiating with pirates is rarely a good idea, but this time you made it work. <br><br>They agree to share some of the gold, shards and supplies from the loot with you!
e_sahti56_a_rp4_f=You approach the pirates, making your best effort to look intimidating, but it doesn’t work.<br><br>They are seasoned warriors, and a group of adventurers is not enough to make them share their loot. <br><br>The inevitable conclusion of this conflict is to draw your weapons and prepare to take if by force.
e_sahti56_a_rp4_fc=You approach the pirates, making your best effort to look intimidating, but it doesn’t work. <br><br>They laugh at you for a while and tell you that you're not going to fool any seasoned warriors, like them. They advise you to put your foolish ambitions to rest or prepare for the worst. <br><br>Since the worst has already happened and they've mocked your stylish approach, there's no other solution but to fight!
e_sahti56_a_rp5=Sss... I can dispatch some of them quickly.
e_sahti56_a_rp5_s=(Thuls): “I will do this for free.”<br><br>Thuls sneaks up behind one of the pirates and takes him out with an expert move. <br><br>As the pirate falls, the others raise the alarm, but you attack before they have a chance to dispose of the supplies or target Thuls! Teamwork makes the dream work!
e_sahti56_a_rp5_f=(Thuls): "I will do this for free."<br><br>Thuls sneaks up behind the biggest pirate, who turns around just in time to see Thuls and stops him from executing a fatal blow. <br><br>The pirate raises the alarm and they start destroying the supplies, forcing you to intervene in disarray. Now the pirates have the advantage!
e_sahti57_a_nm=The whale graveyard
e_sahti57_a_dsc=This place is filled with the bones of whales and other gargantuan creatures. It seems to be where the largest inhabitants of the sea come for their final rest. However, that's not the most unsettling aspect of this place.<br><br>What sends shivers down your spine is the fact that their voices still echo in this chamber. If you close your eyes, it's as if you can almost see the whales.<br><br>Perhaps it's caused by some form of magic. It might be worth investigating further.
e_sahti57_a_dsca=Would you like to investigate it?
e_sahti57_a_rp0=It’s probably nothing. Let’s continue our journey.
e_sahti57_a_rp0_s=Time is on the essence so you decide to not stop here. <br><br>Whatever is happening here, is not dangerous.
e_sahti57_a_rp1=This may be something interesting. Let’s investigate it.
e_sahti57_a_rp1_s=You investigate the graveyard and make an amazing discovery. <br><br>The noises you hear emanate from the residual magic of the creatures that perished here. The reverberations caused by this magic, mixed with the energies of the cave, produce these unique sounds. You theorize that if a creature was powerful enough, it could manifest more than just sounds.<br><br>Uncertain how long it might take to confirm your theory, you gather some shards on your way out and leave the area.
e_sahti57_a_rp1_sc=You investigate the graveyard and make an amazing discovery. <br><br>The noises you hear emanate from the vestigial magic of the creatures that perished here. The reverberations caused by this magic, mixed with the energies of the cave, create these unique sounds. To your surprise, you even witness magical manifestations of the creatures.<br><br>Seeing the creatures so cheerful and happy brightens your mood. When the magic dissipates, you find magic shards remaining among the bones.
e_sahti57_a_rp1_f=You investigate the graveyard but fail to discover anything of interest. <br><br>Although there are some shards scattered around, you hear the eerie noises of creatures nearby, as if they were observing your every move. You decide against taking anything and choose to move on.<br><br>Some mysteries are better left unsolved, and this might be one of them.
e_sahti57_a_rp1_fc=You investigate the graveyard but fail to discover anything of interest. <br><br>Despite finding some shards, you hear the noises of creatures nearby, as if they are watching your every move. Deciding not to take anything, you continue on your way.<br><br>As you leave, the creatures seem to chase you, and spectral voices harass you. Their haunting voices linger long after you've departed.
e_sahti57_a_rp2=It is just some random sound. Let’s sack this graveyard.
e_sahti57_a_rp2_s=You decide to ignore the fading voices and plunder whatever might be useful in this graveyard. After all, the whales and behemoths that died here may have swallowed valuable treasures!<br><br>As time passes, the voices become barely audible, allowing you to focus on your search. <br><br>It takes longer than expected to plunder the area, but the effort proves worthwhile as you discover shards of magic and gold among the creature’s bones.
e_sahti57_a_rp2_sc=You decide to ignore the sound and plunder whatever may be useful in this graveyard. After all, the whales and behemoths that died here may have swallowed valuable treasures!<br><br>As time passes, the voices fade and become barely audible by the time you begin your search. <br><br>It takes longer than expected to thoroughly explore the area, but the effort proves worthwhile as you uncover numerous shards and gold among the creature’s bones.
e_sahti57_a_rp2_f=You decide to ignore the sound and loot whatever might be useful in this graveyard. After all, the whales and behemoths that died here may have swallowed valuable treasures!<br><br>The voices grow louder and more intense, threatening to give you a serious headache. Reluctantly, you decide to leave before they become unbearable.<br><br>Fortunately, you are able to resume your journey without lasting consequences.
e_sahti57_a_rp2_fc=You decide to ignore the sound and loot whatever may be useful in this graveyard. After all, the whales and behemoths that died here may have swallowed valuable treasures!<br><br>The voices grow increasingly intense and louder, forcing you to leave before they cause a serious headache. <br><br>Unfortunately, it seems you are unable to shake off the voices now—they are stuck in your head.
e_sahti57_a_rp3=That white whale is here! Let’s help it!
e_sahti57_a_rp3_s=You decide to ignore the weird noises and eerie feeling of this place and focus on helping the whale that lies severely wounded in the cave. <br><br>It is indeed the white whale that the whalers were chasing. Its wounds are lethal, and the only thing you can do for the whale is to try to ease the pain of its injuries. As you do this, you feel the whale thanking you and passing away in peace. <br><br>In silence, you leave this place with a feeling of relief for being there in its last moments.
e_sahti57_a_rp4=The white whale is here! Time to finish the job!
e_sahti57_a_rp4_s=You decide to ignore the weird noises and eerie feeling of this place and focus your attention on the wounded whale that lies in the cave.<br><br>It is the whale that the whalers you defeated were chasing. It is clear that the animal is not going to leave this place alive, and it seems that when it felt its end near, it came here to die in peace. That’s something you can help the whale with, so with a precise strike, you finish it. <br><br>Once the whale is dead, you continue your journey without giving a second thought to the futility of this nonsensical violence against such a majestic creature, but it is okay. You are the one who will have to live with it.
e_sahti58_a_nm=The abyssal trench
e_sahti58_a_dsc=Before you lie the unfathomable depths of the abyssal trench. <br><br>However, something shiny catches your attention, almost supernaturally. <br><br>You could reach it, and who knows what else might be down there, but venturing so deep will undoubtedly test your ability to withstand the harshness of the ocean's depths.
e_sahti58_a_dsca=Are you willing to take the risk?
e_sahti58_a_rp0=It looks very dangerous and we have better things to do.
e_sahti58_a_rp0_s=You decide to continue your journey. <br><br>After all, you are getting closer to the obelisk, and time is of the essence.
e_sahti58_a_rp1=Let’s go, but only a short distance to keep it safe.
e_sahti58_a_rp1_s=Fortune favors the bold, or in this case, the cautious, as the precious gem is within your reach without risking too much. <br><br>Before retreating, you realize that there is plenty of gold and shards within the abyssal trench. <br><br>Even if it was an easy catch, you couldn't avoid swallowing some water.
e_sahti58_a_rp2=Let’s go, but only a reasonable distance.
e_sahti58_a_rp2_s=Fortune favors the bold! You reach the precious gem and push a little further. <br><br>You manage to gather some gold and shards before running out of air. <br><br>The distance feels longer on the way back, but you make it before any serious injury occurs, although you swallow a lot of water.
e_sahti58_a_rp3=Let’s see how far we can go!
e_sahti58_a_rp3_s=Fortune favors the bold, and this is a great chance to push yourself to the limits! <br><br>You reach the gem with ease, and everyone tries to extend their time underwater as much as possible, looting everything you can find. <br><br>In the end, you gather a good amount of gold and shards, but at the expense of your health, as you swallow a lot of water.
e_sahti58_a_rp4=Hmm... Do you want me to reach for that shiny thing?
e_sahti58_a_rp4_s=Bernard disappears into the black water of the abyssal trench. For a moment, you fear that the old alchemist got lost on his way. <br><br>After a few minutes, Bernard reappears, not only with the precious stone, but also with some shards and gold. <br><br>He tells you that the trench is full of treasures, but they are beyond the point of no return and not worth the risk.
e_sahti62_a_nm=The Rust King
e_sahti62_a_dsc=In front of you lies a great treasure surrounding a throne on which the remnants of a high naval officer rest. Before you continue, you notice a huge eel carefully watching the skeleton on the throne. A ghostly presence floats beside the eel, contemplating the portrait of a distinguished pirate near the throne.<br><br>That must be the legendary Rust King and his trusty pet, Pitt the eel. Together, they were the scourge of the seas long ago!<br><br>They stand between you and the obelisk, seemingly unaware of your presence.
e_sahti62_a_dsca=You may have time to prepare a strategy.
e_sahti62_a_rp0=Let’s attack now!
e_sahti62_a_rp0_s=Without wasting a second, you charge at the Rust King and his pet, Pitt the eel.
e_sahti62_a_rp1=Let’s try to catch our breath first.
e_sahti62_a_rp1_s=Even at the risk of being caught, you decide it’s a good idea to hide and catch your breath before the upcoming fight. <br><br>The Rust King and his pet look like terrifying opponents! The good news is that you manage to rest a bit and are ready to fight. The bad news is that the Rust King spotted you and had time to prepare as well. <br><br>At least you’re rested when the battle begins!
e_sahti62_a_rp1_sc=Even at the risk of being caught, you decide it’s a good idea to hide and catch your breath before the upcoming fight. <br><br>The Rust King and his pet look like terrifying opponents! The good news is that you find a great place to rest and quickly feel refreshed. The bad news is that the Rust King seems to always be prepared, leaving you no chance to gain the initiative in this combat. <br><br>With renewed energy, you charge into the fight!
e_sahti62_a_rp1_f=Even at the risk of being caught, you decide it’s a good idea to hide and catch your breath before the upcoming fight. <br><br>You find a spot that seems safe, but shortly after you start to rest, Pitt the eel suddenly appears and tries to electrocute you! <br><br>You dodge most of the attack and are forced to fight, but at least you managed to get some rest.
e_sahti62_a_rp1_fc=Even at the risk of being caught, you decide it’s a good idea to hide and catch your breath before the upcoming fight. <br><br>You find a spot that seems safe, but shortly after you start to rest, Pitt the eel suddenly appears and tries to electrocute you! <br><br>Unable to dodge its attack, the battle begins before you have time to recover!
e_sahti62_a_rp2=Let’s try to flank them!
e_sahti62_a_rp2_s=You execute the flanking maneuver flawlessly, exposing the weak points of the Rust King and his pet!
e_sahti62_a_rp2_sc=You execute the flanking maneuver flawlessly, exposing the weak points of the Rust King and his pet!<br><br>They have a hard time getting ready for the fight!
e_sahti62_a_rp2_f=Your flanking maneuver is unsuccessful as Pitt the eel intercepts you, delivering a shocking welcome!
e_sahti62_a_rp2_fc=Your flanking maneuver is unsuccessful as Rust king himself shoots you as soon as you move!
e_sahti62_a_rp3=Aim to the eel!
e_sahti62_a_rp3_s=You remember that you have been told to attack the eel and you focus your efforts on that strategy!
e_sahti62_a_rp4=Blackbeard thinks the eel is the key. Focus on the creature!
e_sahti62_a_rp4_s=Blackbeard's words echo in your mind. He told you that if he ever had the chance to face the Rust King, he would focus his efforts on the eel first. <br><br>The skilled pirate is not here today, but his wisdom will help you achieve victory! <br><br>You focus all your attacks on Pitt the Eel.
e_sahti62_b_nm=The treasure of the Rust King
e_sahti62_b_dsc=The fearsome Rust King and his Eel Pitt have been defeated, and now it's time for you to delve into his huge treasure.<br><br>The riches you find here are a testament to how successful the Rust King was in life.<br><br>It's a pity that you can't carry all of them with you, but your space is limited, and you must continue your journey to rescue the princess!
e_sahti62_b_dsca=You open the most promising chests.
e_sahti62_b_rp0=These treasures seem to be the best preserved.
e_sahti62_b_rp0_s=On closer inspection, you find that rust has affected most of the items and coins, and some treasures are beyond repair. <br><br>You gather the ones that look the best, which happen to be the most powerful ones.

e_sahti65_a_nm=The Kraken's treasure
e_sahti65_a_dsc=Finally, the Kraken's corpse is within your reach. Now that you can touch it, you can believe that it’s truly dead, though even in death, the creature still crackles with residual electricity—a testament to its immense power. <br><br>You realize this must be its nest, as there are countless treasures and wrecked ships around you. <br><br>Looking around, you can imagine how many souls met their demise at the Kraken’s tentacles, but you have avenged them, and now all its treasures belong to you alone.
e_sahti65_a_dsca=Time to loot!
e_sahti65_a_rp0=Let's see what treasures the Kraken had plundered.
e_sahti65_a_rp0_s=Among the victims of the kraken, you find a lot of interesting treasures and gold. <br><br>And now it is all yours!
e_sahti65_a_rp1=You feel something powerful inside the Kraken.
e_sahti65_a_rp1_s=You feel the urge to raise your hand, and suddenly, images of the stone thunder rune you found on the island with the crater appear in your mind.<br><br>So that's where the Kraken's power came from! Now you realize, but before you can fully process this revelation, something flies from the Kraken to your hand.<br><br>And here you are, holding the legendary hammer Mjolnir, imbued with the power of thunder.
e_sahti65_a_rp2=Something is calling me... It’s coming!
e_sahti65_a_rp2_s=Sigrun raises her arm, and from inside the Kraken, an electric hammer flies toward her worthy hands.<br><br>(Sigrun): “Now I remember. My people tell the tale of this hammer and how it chooses its wielder only if the person has a pure and noble heart. It has been lost for so many years that many began to doubt its existence, and eventually, we stopped looking for it. If the Kraken ate it, no wonder it became such a powerful foe!<br><br>I don’t remember what happened to me, but with this in my hands, I know that I am on the right path. Loot the wicked creature’s treasures while I ponder the meaning of this.”
e_sahti65_a_rp3=I feel something inside it... it’s calling me!
e_sahti65_a_rp3_s=rptd_e_sahti65_a_rp2_s
e_sahti65_a_rp3_f=Sigrun raises her arm, and the residual electricity around the kraken crackles with more intensity for a moment before disappearing.<br><br>She lowers her arm, disappointed, as she expected something exceptional to happen, only for it to change its mind at the last minute.<br><br>You loot the kraken and the nearby treasures while Sigrun looks at the creature's carcass in sadness.

e_sahti69_a_rp0=Let them come onto our ship!
e_sahti69_a_rp0_s=You brace for impact and fight the pirates on your ship. <br><br>The officers of your ship have fallen in combat; if you survive this fight, you may gain control of the ship!<br><br>After the battle you will make sure to strip these pirates of all their gold.

e_sahti69_a_rp2_s=(Bernard): “Hmm... This better serve as a lesson, as there are many untrustworthy pirates in these waters. Come with me, I will have some words with their captain.”<br><br>Amid the chaos, you follow Bernard to the pirate’s quarterdeck, where Bernard reprimands the captain for his behavior. The captain is indebted to Bernard for saving his life in the past and agrees to retreat and take you where you need to go. <br><br>However, some members of the crew disagree with the deal and attack you, but you are prepared to repel them!
e_sahti69_a_rp3=The pirates are the real scourge of these waters. I will defeat them.
e_sahti69_a_rp3_s=(Sigrun): “These pirates feed on the innocent people of these islands and have caused a lot of disgrace among the Sahti. In some ways, they are even worse than the COT! The first lesson that the Shati people teach their kids is to always expect pirates. Follow me; we will strike down their officers at once!”<br><br>It is clear that this fight is personal for Sigrun, and that she really knows how to move on a deck. She creates openings, and you are able to reach the quarterdeck and face the pirate officers directly.<br><br>If you win, you may take control of this ship!
e_sahti9_a_nm=The monkey island
e_sahti9_a_dsc=You arrive at a strange island marked by a large monkey head sculpted into the rock, forming a cavern.<br><br>Inside, a ghostly monkey materializes before you and demands a blood sacrifice in exchange for great wisdom.<br><br>The monkey laughs as the cavern entrance seals shut, proclaiming that it will only reopen once blood has been spilled.
e_sahti9_a_dsca=A ghostly blade materializes before you. Who will wield it?
e_sahti9_a_rp0=Let's fortune decide our fate!
e_sahti9_a_rp0_s=The chosen volunteer uses the ghostly blade to make a cut on their hand. The blade absorbs the blood, and the entrance gradually opens.<br><br>Meanwhile, the monkey laughs maniacally at you. He advises you to always stay a couple of steps ahead of your enemies and promises his blessing will help. <br><br>He also warns against accepting ghostly blades from strangers, questioning where they might have been.
e_sahti9_a_rp0_f=Fortunately, you were not chosen for the monkey's game.
e_sahti9_a_rp1=I will do it!
e_sahti9_a_rp1_s=The volunteer uses the ghostly blade to make a cut on their hand. The blade absorbs the blood, and the entrance slowly opens.<br><br>Meanwhile, the monkey laughs maniacally and tells you to always stay a few steps ahead of your enemies, assuring you that his blessing will help you do that. <br><br>He also advises you not to accept the ghostly blade of a stranger—who knows where it might have been?
e_sahti9_a_rp2=My snake tells me that you're not trustworthy.
e_sahti9_a_rp2_s=The monkey is surprised to see Malukah's snake, and they begin to converse. You can't quite tell if they're on good or bad terms; it resembles a sibling squabble. <br><br>When their discussion ends, the monkey lowers his head, and the entrance gradually opens. The snake informs you that her brother apologizes and won't attempt to take your blood again. <br><br>She explains that he has always been the most mischievous in the family but isn't an evil loa. As you leave, the monkey even bestows a blessing upon you.
e_sahti9_a_rp3=Hmm... Is this how you treat an old friend?
e_sahti9_a_rp3_s=The monkey suddenly drops his facade when he realizes Bernard is here and begins to jump and cheer around him.<br><br>Bernard speaks with the monkey, and they share a laugh that seems to last an eternity. Finally, they turn to the rest of the group, and the monkey apologizes for trying to exsanguinate you, explaining that it’s an old habit he's trying to break.<br><br>The gates open, and you are free to go. Before you leave, the monkey blesses his friend Bernard and wishes you all good luck on your quest!
e_sahti9_b_nm=Three loas
e_sahti9_b_dsc=You arrive at a strange island shaped like a monkey. <br><br>At the base of the monkey’s head, there are several Loa statues, but among them are three broken ones that you can barely distinguish, though they seem to represent a lion, a deer, and an eagle. <br><br>You look around and find some materials and tools, but there are only enough to repair one of the statues.
e_sahti9_b_dsca=Would you like to repair one of the statues?
e_sahti9_b_rp0=rptd_e_sahti12_a_rp0
e_sahti9_b_rp0_s=You're in a hurry, and from what you've heard about the Loa, they may not react well if you repair only one statue and leave the other two unattended. <br><br>So, you decide to continue your journey, ignoring the statues.
e_sahti9_b_rp1=Let’s repair the one that looks like a lion.
e_sahti9_b_rp1_s=After you finish repairing the statue, a male voice speaks from it and tells you that the lion must preserve traditions and maintain order. He must lead by example and honor. <br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the lion.
e_sahti9_b_rp1_sc=After you finish repairing the lion statue, a male voice speaks from it and tells you the story of the lion.<br><br>He faced a cruel rebellion against the old Loa ways and was a paragon of virtue and honor until the bitter end. He never asked others to do anything he wouldn't do himself and was always the first to charge the enemy. In the end, he understood that while changes can be necessary, they must always respect traditions, for, ultimately, that is all that matters.<br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the lion.
e_sahti9_b_rp1_f=You repair the statue, but it barely resembles anything recognizable. <br><br>You might have created a new category of abstract modern art, but nothing significant happens once you give it the final touch.

e_sahti9_b_rp2=Let’s repair the one that looks like a deer.
e_sahti9_b_rp2_s=After you finish repairing the deer statue, a male voice speaks from it and tells you that the deer must always be cunning and think quickly in order to survive. It must stay one step ahead of its adversaries. <br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the deer.

e_sahti9_b_rp3_s=After you finish repairing the eagle statue, a female voice emanates from it and tells you that it is the eagle's responsibility to use her power to defy traditions and change the world for the better. <br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the eagle.
e_sahti9_b_rp3_sc=After you finish repairing the eagle statue, a female voice emanates from it and tells you the story of the eagle. <br><br>She explains how she used her power and reputation to challenge the Loa’s traditions and how she was perceived as evil for doing so. However, she did not care what others thought of her because she knew her intentions were for the greater good, and in the end, that is all that matters. <br><br>You feel infused with the spirit of the eagle.

e_aquar18_a_rp11=Hmm... This reminds me of the Singing Brook Tavern!
e_aquar18_a_rp11_s=To your surprise, Bernard sings a song from his youth that he used to sing during his travels, and it fits perfectly with the soft tone emanating from the altar.<br><br>It seems the senior alchemist still has some rhythm from his younger days, as the altar is brimming with energy and offers you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade one card for free for each hero.

e_aquar18_a_rp12=I can sing a song in tune with this place.
e_aquar18_a_rp12_s=Sigrun sings a song, and even though it is in an unknown language, her voice sounds beautiful.

e_aquar24_a_rp8_s=Sigrun tells you that the runes are extremely familiar to her and that, somehow, she understands their meaning.<br><br>She approaches the runes and touches them.

e_aquar27_b_rp7=That brine smell... Watch out, it’s a trap!
e_aquar27_b_rp7_s=You remember something from your time in the Sahti Islands: the story of a trapper with an intense smell of brine.<br><br>This prompts you to search the room for traps, just in case, and you find plenty of them. Could this be where the giant went after he left Halfman’s ship?<br><br>You don't have much time to think about it, as the others are about to enter.

e_aquar27_b_rp8=Hmm...I am old enough to know that this place is trapped. Let me go first.

Heed my words, for I, Sigrun, daughter of the storm, will summon the light that will ease your pain and give you a merciful rest.”<br><br>You step aside as Sigrun continues her chanting, and very soon, a lightning storm forms overhead. Suddenly, thunderbolts start striking the cocoons, releasing the creatures inside from the torment of their existence.<br><br>As quickly as it comes, it leaves, and the sky clears again. If there was anything useful in the cocoons, it has been destroyed by the storm, but at least some shards have formed in the area, and you are able to gather them while Sigrun meditates on this.
e_aquar23_a_rp7=Hmm... A fellow alchemist. May we share recipes and knowledge, yes?
e_aquar23_a_rp7_s=Bernard and Malukah speak for a while and share their extensive alchemical knowledge with each other.<br><br>The conversation is pleasant, and although Malukah doesn’t know where to find the Philosopher's Stone that Bernard is looking for, she teaches him a spell that may help him on his quest, as well as offers a 30% discount at her shop.<br><br>While they are speaking, the rest of you look around to see if there are any potions that interest you.

But if you want to open it, don’t waste your time, leave it to me.”<br><br>Without thinking twice, Bree crushes the top of each box with her axe.<br><br>It seems that the contents are intact, be it by pure luck or because they are sturdier than Bree gives them credit for.
e_aquar48_a_rp6_s=(Heiner) “Beep... These boxes are made of bald cypress lumber, iron nails and a layer of paint made with local plants and insects. They are not sturdy enough to resist the strength I am able to apply. Awaiting instructions... Beep.”<br><br>You nod to Heiner, and without wasting a second, he bends the top of the box with a mixture of raw strength and delicacy that you didn’t expect from him.<br><br>The contents are intact and you can loot them without problems. 
e_aquar48_a_rp7_s=Once you are close enough for Grukli to reach the boxes, he grabs his axe and brutalize the boxes in a savage way.<br><br>You have never seen someone hate some boxes so much. You are sure that the boxes' owners must hear you, but at the same time, you are quite sure that no one would dare get between Grukli and the boxes. Once the boxes are reduced to splinters, Grukli laughs and sits in the boat.<br><br>Somehow, the contents of the boxes are intact, and you can loot them while the half-dwarf sits laughing. 
e_aquar48_a_rp8_s=(Malukah) “This place is where the crocomen gather their goods before sending them to their customers.<br><br>Sometimes they even buy my potions to include among their goods, but they always pay me a fair price or help me acquire some... special ingredients for my concoctions.<br><br>Among the dwellers of the swamp, we respect each other, so if you want to get something from that boxes, I will make a deal with their leader and pay him later. Our mission requires all the help that we can find.”
e_lair8_a_rp7=Hmm... This cave is full of materials; I can try to make a simple antivenom potion. 
e_lair8_a_rp7_s=(Bernard): “I have been saving some materials from this cave as we traverse it, and I think I have enough to create something useful.”<br><br>Bernard quickly mixes some ingredients, and although the resulting mixture is not much, it is powerful enough to protect you with just a few drops. The potion tastes bitter, but you definitely feel more protected against poison!<br><br>And it seems you will be testing it very soon, as Tulah notices you just as you finish drinking, and the fight begins!
e_lair8_a_rp7_f=(Bernard): “I have been saving some materials from this cave as we traverse it, and I think I have enough to create something useful.”<br><br>Bernard quickly mixes some ingredients, and the resulting mixture is plentiful. He instructs you to take a long sip of it. The potion tastes awful, and you wonder if Bernard used too much poison or if he simply wants to kill you! You feel really bad after drinking it and not protected at all!<br><br>When Tulah notices you, it’s so clear that your potion was a failure that she laughs at you before attacking!

e_faen33_a_rp7=Hmm... I think I have the proper potion to save this elf.
e_faen33_a_rp7_s=Bernard opens one of his flasks and pours its contents over the ice, which melts in seconds. Then the elf, with an angry face, says to you:<br><br>"What are you doing! I locked myself in the ice on purpose! It was my grand strategy to collect gold and avoid the frozen dead patrols. But who do you think you are to do this?"<br><br>Before he can continue, Bernard slaps him with his cane to make him shut up. The elf then runs away crying like a child. Luckily for you, with the slap, he drops the bag with gold and shards.

e_sen21_b_rp3=Fear not, we will help you. 
e_sen21_b_rp3_s=(Sigrun): “I feel the goodness in your heart, and I will not let evildoers bully you.

e_ulmin9_b_rp3_s=Sharing is caring! Bernard shares his potion with the group, and you feel better in no time.<br><br>The concoction is a mixture of different magical liquids and salts.

e_velka42_a_rp7=I will show them the true power of a daughter of the storm!
e_velka42_a_rp7_s=Sigrun steps forward and starts chanting a spell. Very soon, a violent thunderstorm appears near the harpies, forcing them to retreat if they don’t want to suffer its effects.<br><br>While Sigrun is casting this spell, you realize that it is almost as if she were singing a song and the thunder was the instrument accompanying her.<br><br>When she finishes casting her spell, the path is clear and the harpies are far away, so you can cross the bridge without any problems.

e_aquar31_a_rp13_s=(Bernard): “I am too old for some water currents, and when I feel the weight of my age, I like to drink this concoction. It will allow us to walk on water, but only for a minute.

Don’t worry, I believe I have some more at home.”<br><br>Without much time to react, you do as Bernard instructs, and it works... kind of.<br><br>The potion is tasteless and leaves a dry sardine aftertaste in your mouth. Although you are able to walk on water and reach safety before the effects wear off, it leaves you with an intense stomachache for a while.

e_sen7_a_rp8_s=(Bernard): “When I was younger, I was known as the Thunderbolt Turtle of the Abyssal Trench.

Although the fish is not big enough to win the contest, the contents of the bag are worth the time and effort.
e_sen7_a_rp9=I have learned a lot of techniques from the Sahti. I believe I can win this.
e_sen7_a_rp9_s=Sigrun focuses on all the teachings she received from the Sahti people who took care of her, and she catches one fish after another.<br><br>She is in the zone, doing it step by step, slowly but steadily, almost like a ritual.<br><br>Eventually, she catches a fish big enough for the werewolves to admit that she is the winner, and they pay you the agreed-upon gold.
e_sen13_b_rp5=Be it bandits, pirates, or whatever name they take, I despise them all!
e_sen13_b_rp5_s=Sigrun jumps with the help of her wings and charges the bandits without a second thought.<br><br>Shortly after she engages them, a lightning bolt strikes nearby.<br><br>By the time you reach her, she is still fighting them, but the air is full of electricity as many more lightning bolts strike nearby!
e_sen25_a_rp16=Hmm... I have plenty of stories; it’s hard to pick just one.
e_sen25_a_rp16_s=(Bernard): “Have you ever heard of a philosopher’s stone? It is said that with it, the mysteries of alchemy can be unveiled, and you can even achieve eternal life if you know how to use it!”<br><br>Bernard tells an interesting story about a group of adventurers searching for a philosopher’s stone and all the dangers they face.

e_sen25_a_rp17=I don’t remember many stories, but I can tell you one that I know well.
e_sen25_a_rp17_s=(Sigrun): “This is the tale of an abandoned child, expelled from her home and lost in an unknown world. She was welcomed by a group of strangers who thought she was special. They revered her, but she didn’t want to be revered; she just wanted a family. When she grew up and became stronger, she swore to protect her family.”<br><br>The werewolves seem to expect the story to become less emotional and more action-driven, but it never reaches that point. When the tale is over, you can hear the werewolves talking about how they feel sorrow for the child in the tale.<br><br>You all have a quiet night and a good rest.
e_velka14_a_rp8=There’s something familiar here... It’s calling me.
e_velka14_a_rp8_s=The lightning bolts seem to move away as Sigrun gets closer to the altar.<br><br>(Sigrun): “The runes engraved on this altar; I have seen them before. The day I... landed on the Sahti Islands, a similarly engraved runestone was near me.

e_ulmin5_b_rp2_fc=The veteran gladiator looks at you, concerned.<br><br>(Retiarius): “Patience, my friends, is what you lack. Every journey has its end; why rush? On second thought, I don’t think you are worthy of the token. Good warriors need more than martial prowess to triumph, and until you acquire those other talents, I will not give you the token. I don’t want your deaths to torment my mind!”<br><br>You sense the determination in his words, so instead of debating him, you just leave the oasis in silence, but somehow, his words still hurt you.

e_sahti12_b_nm=The jolly gladiator
e_sahti12_b_dsc=A veteran warrior is tending his wounds on what looks like a battlefield between the navy and the pirates. He tells you that you are late, as the pirates have already been defeated.<br><br>When you inform him that you are adventurers on your way to a mission, he laughs and tells you that he used to be an adventurer too, until he found Velkarath Colosseum and became the most famous secutor the arena ever knew.<br><br>He is retired now but misses the heat of battle, though he knows that someday his lust for battle will be greater than his strength. However, if you prove yourselves good attackers, he may give you a special arena badge to challenge Velkarath coliseum’s special trial.
e_sahti12_b_dsca=Do you want the arena badge that he is offering?
e_sahti12_b_rp0=We don’t have time for this.
e_sahti12_b_rp0_s=You decline his offer and prefer to continue your journey.
e_sahti12_b_rp1=If offensive is what you want, I am the right one!
e_sahti12_b_rp1_s=You show the veteran secutor a collection of your most successful combat moves, and he is quite impressed by the variety and effectiveness of your repertoire. He tells you that battles are won on the offensive, and knowing when and how to strike is the only way to achieve greatness.<br><br>Having proven your worth, the secutor hands you the token and tells you to take it to the Velkarath Colosseum, where you will face a powerful enemy. He wishes you the best of luck in that fight, but after seeing your moves, he is sure you won’t need it!<br><br>You share a few tales of battles won thanks to a decisive strike before resuming your journey.
e_sahti12_b_rp1_f=You show the veteran secutor a collection of your most successful combat moves, and he wonders how you’ve managed to defeat a single foe on your journey.<br><br>He considers your moves very basic and uninspired, the typical moves of someone greener than a lettuce. He says that if he wants to send someone to fight, it’s not to an execution.<br><br>You feel a little upset by how he says it, but you decide to continue your journey without giving it a second thought.
e_sahti12_b_rp2=We are seasoned warriors, what else do we have to prove?
e_sahti12_b_rp2_s=The veteran gladiator laughs at the top of his lungs.<br><br>(Secutor): “That’s the spirit! Here, take this token and show it in Velkarath’s arena, but beware, for you will face some of the most fearsome enemies you have ever encountered there! As it should be! I expect nothing less from you than a glorious victory!”<br><br>You share some tales of battles while he finishes bandaging his wound, and once he’s done, you leave in a good mood.
e_sahti12_b_rp2_f=The veteran gladiator laughs at the top of his lungs.<br><br>(Secutor): “Do you really think so? Then you’re greener than a lettuce! As a warrior, you’re always proving yourself. It’s when you think you have nothing left to prove that you end up with a sword through your chest! I’m not going to give you the token. It wouldn’t be a fight for you, but an execution!”<br><br>You feel really upset by the way he says that, as if you were a bunch of weaklings, but instead of arguing with the old gladiator, you decide to leave.

e_velka12_a_rp4=Show the arena badge and face the special challenge.
e_velka12_a_rp4_s=The coliseum goes silent when the announcer says that you are going to face the special challenge.<br><br>For a moment, the only noise that can be heard in the great arena is Astarios’ roar as he prepares for the special challenge.<br><br>Before the doors finish opening, Astarios breaks through them and charges at you, with extraordinary aggression even for a minotaur like him!
e_velka12_a5_nm=The secret legacy
e_velka12_a5_dsc=The crowd cheers your victory! Not only have you defeated Astarios, but you have also defeated Astorhus, the former champion, at the same time! This fight will be remembered and talked about everywhere for a long time.<br><br>As the new champions of the arena, you've won a commemorative trophy and a good amount of gold. After enjoying the crowd's favor and chants for a while, you decide to move to the rest area.<br><br>While you are resting and preparing to split your loot, the arena owner enters the room and speaks to you.
e_velka12_a5_dsca=You listen what she says.
e_velka12_a5_rp0=We are listening. 
e_velka12_a5_rp0_s=She gives you an ancient badge with the shape of a wooden sword and tells you that, under normal circumstances, she would offer you a place as the resident champions in the arena.<br><br>However, she wonders if you might help her find the legendary gladiatorial plaza instead. Many champions have searched for it in the past, even her former gladiator friends, but none have ever found it.<br><br>She believes that you may be the one chosen to find the legendary gladiatorial plaza.<br><br>You agree to carry on the gladiators' legacy and search for that place.
e_voidlow5_c_nm=The gladiatorial plaza
e_voidlow5_c_dsc=You arrive at a plaza that matches the description given by the arena owner. The plaza indeed looks like a proper fighting place, as there are several constructs battling each other. Could this be the legendary site where the ultimate gladiatorial fight will take place?<br><br>You can’t continue because the creatures are fighting in the middle of your path, so you show your ancient badge. Upon seeing it, the constructs stop fighting each other and separate into two groups, each with their champion at the front, seemingly awaiting your instructions.<br><br>It looks like they are waiting for you to choose a group to face in combat!
e_voidlow5_c_dsca=Which group do you choose?
e_voidlow5_c_rp0=We will face the white ones.
e_voidlow5_c_rp0_s=As you choose the white ones, the black ones step aside and let you fight.<br><br>The white group gets into position along with their champion, and the battle begins.

e_voidlow5_c_rp2=We will face both!
e_voidlow5_c_rp2_s=Each champion chooses a couple of warriors of their color and gets into position while the other constructs step aside.<br><br>The battle begins!
e_voidlow5_c1_nm=The gladiator’s legacy
e_voidlow5_c1_dsc=The battle was intense, but victory was finally yours. It seems that the ultimate gladiatorial fight was nothing more than an extreme sparring session against these creatures!<br><br>As this place seems really old, you wonder if the legend of this site was distorted over time, eventually glorifying a mundane task.<br><br>Nonetheless, the experience you’ve gained here is invaluable, and you’re sure you can salvage something from the debris of the broken constructs on the battlefield.
e_voidlow5_c1_dsca=At least the constructs stand aside and acknowledge you as champions, allowing you to continue your journey.
e_voidlow5_c1_rp0=Excellent. Let’s search for some treasure before continuing. 
e_voidlow5_c1_rp0_s=You gather some useful loot and decide how to split it.
e_ulmin19_a_rp3=I know this story well! We should look for the pieces that go as follows...
e_ulmin19_a_rp3_s=With Laia's help, you manage to assemble the pieces according to how the tale should continue.<br><br>A few years after punishing the paladin, the herons began to question whether they had done the right thing. From their perspective, she had done the right thing by fighting against the Archons. So, the herons appealed to Basthet, asking for mercy for the paladin. However, their only response was losing Basthet's favor, and they eventually abandoned the oasis in the southern desert.<br><br>Laia tells you that instead of admiring the courage the herons showed in questioning their benefactor, you should learn that Basthet's will is not to be questioned.
e_ulmin19_a_rp4=I will rebuild it. I have a trick for this.
e_ulmin19_a_rp4_s=(Nenukil): “The key is to focus on the edges of the slabs. Start by filling in the ones on the borders, working from the outer edges toward the center. See? Here you can read the story.”<br><br>A few years after punishing the paladin, the herons began to question whether they had made the right decision. From their perspective, she had done the right thing by fighting against the Archons. So, the herons appealed to Basthet, asking for mercy for the paladin. However, their only response was losing Basthet's favor, leading them to eventually abandon the oasis in the southern desert.<br><br>Nenukil is not impressed with their story, but you find the herons' courage in questioning their benefactor to be inspiring.
e_ulmin27_a_rp5=I hope that by great mistake you mean doubting Basthet!
e_ulmin27_a_rp5_s=The herons realize that the feline speaking is none other than Laia, Basthet’s current champion. They grow nervous about what might happen next, but Laia quickly deescalates the situation.<br><br>(Laia): “We are on a mission, and if you have supplies to spare, we may be interested in purchasing them. You should seek Basthet’s forgiveness, and I’m sure that if you offer us a good deal, it will be a great start for you.”<br><br>The herons don’t want any trouble and show you what they have for sale, offering a 10% discount.
e_ulmin56_a_rp4=I am the master of dark magic, you undead must obey me!
e_ulmin56_a_rp4_s=Zek tries to control the lich, but the undead creature's magic is unmatched, and he is unable to subdue him. So, he opts for his best alternative.<br><br>In a clever use of dark energy, while the lich and Zek are focused on controlling their magical powers, the ratman overcharges the lich’s magic, causing him to lose control and triggering an explosion.<br><br>This wounds the lich and gives you time to get into position. In the end, Zek proves himself right when he claims to be the master of dark magic!
e_ulmin56_a_rp4_f=Zek tries to control the lich, but the undead creature's magic is unmatched, and he is unable to subdue him. So, he opts for his best alternative.<br><br>In a risky move, while the lich and Zek are focused on controlling their magical powers, the ratman overcharges the lich’s magic. However, instead of losing control, the lich quickly redirects it at Zek, causing him a severe burn.<br><br>Fortunately, you are able to intervene before the lich inflicts more damage on the self-proclaimed master of dark magic.
e_ulmin56_a_rp5=With a prayer to the Light, I will send this creature to its rest.
e_ulmin56_a_rp5_s=Reginald prays to the Light, and a bolt of holy energy emanates from his weapon, striking the lich.<br><br>For a moment, the creature seems unable to move, but it slowly regains control of itself, though it is now infused with the power of the Light and visibly weakened.<br><br>Reginald readies his weapon without saying a word, prepared to finish the job, and you follow his lead.
e_ulmin56_a_rp5_f=Reginald prays to the Light, and a bolt of holy energy emanates from his weapon, striking the lich.<br><br>For a moment, a blinding light illuminates the room, giving you hope that the creature has succumbed to its power. But when the light fades, the creature is still there, intact.<br><br>Before you can react, the lich unleashes a powerful magic attack that severely burns Reginald. You all form up around him, preparing to smite this evil.
e_sahti25_a1_rp5=Give me a moment to study the mechanism, and I'll open it.
e_sahti25_a1_rp5_s=Nenukil walks around the room, inspecting the walls and every detail surrounding the pictures. Like a dog tracking its prey, the dwarf follows a clue he believes is the key to triggering the mechanism.<br><br>He explains that it’s based on a series of tubes and pipes that will likely shoot poisoned darts unless the correct hidden key is pressed in one of the pictures.<br><br>Nenukil stops before a picture and strikes it with the stock of his rifle, opening the doors and granting you clear access to the treasures in the next room.
e_sahti25_a2_rp4=Beep... According to my analysis I can lift that door with a 100% success rate.
e_sahti25_a2_rp4_s=You’re all pleasantly surprised to hear that and encourage Heiner to do his best lifting the door. You know he’s strong, but that door looks incredibly heavy!<br><br>Heiner grabs the iron door with his powerful hands and lifts it just enough to insert his shield beneath it, preventing the door from closing again.<br><br>Although Heiner’s technique seems safe enough, he stays close to the door while you loot the arsenal.
e_sahti25_a3_rp5=Sss... I can open that warehouse door in no time.
e_sahti25_a3_rp5_s=Thuls approaches the warehouse door and opens its simple lock in no time.<br><br>Inside, you find plenty of supplies for your ship, canvas, tar, and planks along with some tools.<br><br>Thuls tells you that he'll be resting in one of the comfortable beds in the infirmary while you split the loot, as he's not interested in this warehouse.

However, you can't help but wonder why he breeds them to sell if it is so hard for him to say goodbye.<br><br>You give him 400g and as he hands you Matey, he says, “Take good care of my feathery friend.

/////// 1.6 Sunken Temple /////
e_sunken10_a_nm=The Spirit Altar
e_sunken10_a_dsc=This altar is dedicated to honoring the Great Bird as the lord of magic and the elements. Its followers believe that, before the Great Bird, magic was pure chaos, and it is thanks to their winged deity that they are now able to control it.<br><br>The altar features a golden statue of the Great Bird, flanked by a sun and a moon, both glowing faintly. It is surrounded by small shards of solidified magic, through which a young snake moves fearlessly, curiously observing the pilgrims.<br><br>A few guards watch over the area, looking rather bored, as this seems to be the least visited temple of the Great Bird.
e_sunken10_a_dsca=Will you do anything at this place?
e_sunken10_a_rp0=There is nothing of interest for us here. Let’s continue our journey.
e_sunken10_a_rp0_s=You are not going to use your shards to honor the Great Bird’s statue, so you decide to continue your journey.<br><br>Somehow, the young snake takes an interest in your group and decides to follow you. It seems you've made a new friend!
e_sunken10_a_rp1=Let’s destroy this place!
e_sunken10_a_rp1_s=You refuse to take part in the Great Bird’s games, and before the guards can react, you destroy the statue with a well-aimed strike!<br><br>As expected, the enraged guards descend upon you, but as you resist and prepare to fight back, you notice the young snake following you. It seems you've sparked its interest!
e_sunken10_a_rp2=All those shards are within our reach; let’s take some.
e_sunken10_a_rp2_s=You all agree that the shards of the altar will serve a better purpose in your hands than in the Great Bird’s cult, so you decide to take them.<br><br>You all approach the altar cautiously, shielding each other from the guards’ sight, and to avoid detection, you take only a few magic shards.<br><br>It appears the young snake approves of your actions and has decided to follow your group!

e_sunken10_a_rp3=Let’s do as those pilgrims told us.
e_sunken10_a_rp3_s=You recall the words of the pilgrims you met shortly after arriving at the temple and follow their advice.<br><br>It turns out they were right, as there are plenty of shards on the ground near the altar. If you tried to take any from the altar itself, the guards might attack you, but gathering them from the ground is safe, so you collect some without the risk of being arrested. Once you have enough, you continue your journey.<br><br>It seems the young snake admired your clever move and decides to follow you. At least with you around, it won’t have time to get bored!
e_sunken10_a_rp4=Those shards are extremely powerful. I will get some.
e_sunken10_a_rp4_s=You approach the Great Bird statue, pretending to be a pilgrim about to make a donation, but instead of leaving any shards, you grab a few and stash them away before anyone notices.<br><br>Just by touching them, you can feel their power, and you wonder if the Great Bird’s statue truly has anything to do with this energy.<br><br>It seems the young snake admired your bold move and decides to follow you.

e_sunken11_a_dsc=This altar is crowded, but among all the pilgrims, a group of warriors catches your attention as they use a sacred candle to ritually burn their bodies, seeking the blessing of the Great Bird’s strength.<br><br>The altar features a golden statue of the Great Bird, surrounded by numerous offerings and gifts from the pilgrims. A young snake, nestled among the gifts, watches everyone in the chamber with curious eyes, though by its expression, you’d guess it’s bored.<br><br>The guards observe the rites with interest.

e_sunken11_a_rp0=There is nothing of interest for us here. Let’s continue our journey.
e_sunken11_a_rp0_s=The statue of the Great Bird is already covered with gifts, and you don’t share the devotion these people have for the Great Bird, so you decide to continue your journey.<br><br>Somehow, the young snake takes an interest in your group and decides to follow you.

e_sunken19_b_nm=The spider grotto
e_sunken19_b_dsc=You find a small grotto with a shrine adorned with spider motifs. It looks unattended, and you wonder why it would be here, as it has nothing to do with the Great Bird. As if reading your mind, Tulah speaks.<br><br>(Tulah): “This is strange. I remember being here some days ago. I was about to do something that, at the time, I thought was our only salvation, but a group of adventurers stopped me. It feels strange to be back here.<br><br>This was my special place. An old shrine dedicated to some ancient spider spirit that I discovered while working as a priestess in the Great Bird’s temple. This was a place where I could meditate and escape the Great Bird’s influence. I learned a lot here.”
e_sunken19_b_dsca=Do you want to spend more time here?
e_sunken19_b_rp0=Actually, we're in a hurry. We shall continue.
e_sunken19_b_rp0_s=Tulah nods. She understands the urgency of the mission, and although she looks disappointed, she agrees that time is of the essence.<br><br>You continue your journey without wasting a minute.
e_sunken19_b_rp1=What else do you know of this shrine?
e_sunken19_b_rp1_s=(Tulah): “This shrine predates the Great Bird’s temple itself. Before the Great Bird’s arrival, all creatures in Aquarfall lived under the protection of the Spider Spirit, who chose this spot for her shrine, as it is where all the magical energies of the swamp converge.<br><br>But as the races of Aquarfall grew in strength and number, they no longer needed the vigilant watch of the Spider Spirit. When the Great Bird arrived and imposed its authority, it had its followers build their main temple here to take advantage of the magical convergence.<br><br>Over time, the spider shrine was forgotten by the temple priestesses, but I stumbled upon it while searching for a place to meditate, far from the Great Bird’s horrors. The Spider Spirit spoke to me and shared her knowledge. But enough stories, we have a bird to hunt. I have some items here that may prove useful.”
e_sunken19_b_rp2=I would like to meditate in the Shrine for a moment.
e_sunken19_b_rp2_s=(Tulah): “The Spider Spirit greatly expanded my knowledge, and I will be forever grateful for that.<br><br>I know that even though I didn’t sacrifice myself as she wanted, the Spider Spirit is happy to see that one of her daughters found the strength to rise against the Great Bird. After all, I am putting all that she taught me to the service of the Aquarfall people, just as the Spider Spirit herself did in the past.”<br><br>Tulah performs her ritual to tend to the shrine, and while she is meditating near it, a spark of energy passes from the shrine to the priestess. Does this mean the Spider Spirit agrees with Tulah? You don’t have time to ponder it, as you must continue your journey, but Tulah feels her skills have improved. Before you depart, Tulah shares some items from the temple.
e_sunken19_b_rp3=I am intrigued by the nature of the Spider Spirit's skills. Could you teach me one, Tulah?
e_sunken19_b_rp3_s=Tulah agrees to teach Reginald one of the most valuable skills she learned from the Spider Spirit, believing it best exemplifies the spirit’s philosophy. <br><br>Reginald, with his extensive experience from his travels, quickly grasps the concepts behind the Spider Spirit’s teachings, much to Tulah’s satisfaction. <br><br>Meanwhile, the rest of you take a moment to catch your breath.

Maybe with your help, I’ll stop fearing spiders!”<br><br>Tulah laughs with Ottis and agrees to teach him a skill that will surely help him stop fearing spiderlings.<br><br>Meanwhile, the rest of you take a moment to catch your breath. Before you depart, Tulah shares some items from the temple.
e_sunken19_b_rp5=Did you know that the path of the Spider Spirit ended with your damnation?
e_sunken19_b_rp5_s=(Tulah): “I know, Malukah, and I was eager to sacrifice everything, even my soul, for the people of Aquarfall. Please, let me show you a useful skill I learned from the Spider Spirit, so you can taste a bit of its power.”<br><br>Malukah reluctantly agrees, as deep down, she knows that she and Tulah are not so different.<br><br>Meanwhile, the rest of you take a moment to catch your breath. Before you depart, Tulah shares some items from the temple.
e_sunken19_b_rp6=Yes, I must admit I am intrigued by the magic of the Spider Spirit.
e_sunken19_b_rp6_s=(Tulah): “You knew I was about to ask if you’d like to learn one of the skills the Spider Spirit taught me, didn’t you? I’m glad you want to learn. Let’s not waste time then.”<br><br>Nezglekt is a quick learner, and he and Tulah seem to share a good moment talking about the nature of Tulah’s magic.<br><br>Meanwhile, the rest of you take a moment to catch your breath. Before you depart, Tulah shares some items from the temple.
e_sunken19_b_rp7=Sss... Could you show me some tricks to protect my kind?
e_sunken19_b_rp7_s=(Tulah): “I was just about to sacrifice everything to help those of your kind, Thuls. Of course I will teach you something to protect your people. Listen carefully.”<br><br>Tulah and Thuls sit near the shrine and practice the ritual Tulah wants to teach him over and over.<br><br>Meanwhile, the rest of you take a moment to catch your breath. Before you depart, Tulah shares some items from the temple.
e_sunken19_b_rp8=You’ve learned great power from the Spider Spirit. Show me!
e_sunken19_b_rp8_s=(Tulah): “Power without purpose is useless, Zek. I will give you a small taste of the Spider Spirit’s power, but before that, I need to explain its meaning to you.”<br><br>Tulah and Zek sit around the shrine and share ideas about power and how to wield it.<br><br>Meanwhile, the rest of you take a moment to catch your breath. Before you depart, Tulah shares some items from the temple.
e_sunken19_b_rp9=Mmm… I would love to learn more about the Spider Spirit's skills.
e_sunken19_b_rp9_s=(Tulah): “Master Bernard, it is an honor that someone as knowledgeable as you want to learn from me. Please allow me to show you a little trick that I believe exemplifies the Spider Spirit’s philosophy very well.”<br><br>Tulah and Bernard sit around the shrine and share a good time together, practicing the spell and talking about philosophy.<br><br>Meanwhile, the rest of you take a moment to catch your breath. Before you depart, Tulah shares some items from the temple.
e_sunken1_a_nm=Rude awakening
e_sunken1_a_dsc=Crossing the portal was a painful experience, and at some point, you lost consciousness. After a while, you finally open your eyes, though a lingering sense of dizziness remains.<br><br>A naga rushes toward you and begins to speak.<br><br>(Naga): “My name is Shn’anke, and I am part of a group fighting against the acolytes of the Great Bird. They use reptilian races as sacrifices for their twisted god. The hot-blooded races of Aquarfall have gone mad!
e_sunken1_a_dsca=Please, help me free the prisoners in the temple!”
e_sunken1_a_rp0=The Great Bird? What are you talking about?
e_sunken1_a_rp0_s=(Shn’anke): “We have received help from a priestess, and something big is about to happen inside the temple. This will give us the chance to rescue our people soon. The fall of the Great Bird is in motion, and it is unstoppable! The prisoners will need all the help we can gather. Will you aid my kind in this dire hour?”<br><br>You are all shocked, as the naga’s words confirm that this is the rebellion that took place in Aquarfall a hundred years ago. Stunned by this revelation, you feel compelled to tell him that you will help.<br><br>Shn’anke's reptilian eyes spark with hope as you venture into the temple.
e_sunken1_a_rp1=Aquarfall has changed so much... yet so little.
e_sunken1_a_rp1_s=(Malukah): “Your kind asking for help? The last time your people cooperated with others was... Oh, I see. We will help. Now, let me speak with my friends, naga.”<br><br>The naga looks puzzled but steps back, giving you space. Once he is far enough, Malukah turns to address the rest of the group.<br><br>(Malukah): “That rift sent us back in time. I've heard the story of this rebellion countless times. The cult of the Great Bird wielded powerful magic, fueled by the blood of the innocent. It’s a very bad mojo, if you ask me. Let’s go. We have to ensure the cult's downfall.”
e_sunken1_a_rp2=Sss... A friendly naga? I have a bad feeling about this.
e_sunken1_a_rp2_s=(Thuls): "Sss... Your people have been hunting my kind since we broke the chains of... oh... I see. We will help. Now leave me alone with my friends, naga."<br><br>The naga looks confused but steps away, giving you space. Once he's far enough, Thuls speaks to the rest of the group.<br><br>(Thuls): "Sss... That rift sent us back in time! Legend says that all cold-blooded races of Aquarfall were once enslaved by a bloodthirsty cult, and that our ancestors united to overthrow them. But in the end, the naga established a tyranny until some races escaped their control. As much as I hate the idea, we must help the naga. Sss... We will deal with them after the cult has been defeated."
e_sunken1_a_rp3=We will help you, master Shn’anke.
e_sunken1_a_rp3_s=The naga is pleased with Amelia’s answer, but just as he is about to speak, she dismisses him with a gesture. Shn’anke understands and leaves your group alone to prepare.<br><br>(Amelia): “That rift sent us back in time. Aquarfall’s history isn’t my specialty, but I’d say we’re in the final days of the rebellion against the Great Bird. This ended with victory for the slave alliance, led by the nagas. Based on my knowledge of rifts, we’ll need to help Shn’anke if we want to return to our time.”<br><br>You all agree with Amelia and proceed to explore the temple.
e_sunken1_a_rp4=Shn’anke? That Shn’anke? Of course we will help!
e_sunken1_a_rp4_s=(Wilbur): “You can count on us, Master Shn’anke, but first allow me to inform my friends about what’s going on.”<br><br>The naga looks confused but steps away, giving you space. Once he's far enough, Wilbur speaks to the rest of the group.<br><br>(Wilbur): “That was Shn’anke the Cruel, but in his youth, he was known as Shn’anke the Meek. Since we haven’t been imprisoned by our reptilian friend, this must be the revolt against the Great Bird in the Sunken Temple, the one that took place in Aquarfall a hundred and three years ago. Be prepared, friends, because we have front-row seats to a historic event! Let’s go!”
e_sunken1_a_rp5=I know the plan. We will help.
e_sunken1_a_rp5_s=The naga stares at Tulah for a moment, and she nods at him. Shn’anke realizes who he is speaking to and leaves to prepare for the prisoners' arrival. Once the naga is gone, Tulah turns to you.<br><br>(Tulah): "He’s waiting for a signal from inside the temple. But I don’t know if that signal will ever come now. Will the Great Bird fall if I don’t embrace the Spider Spirit’s poisonous fate? <br><br>The cold-blooded people are suffering, and we have the tools to end this madness, to give them hope. Whatever happens today, we must bring an end to the Great Bird’s tyranny."
e_sunken22_a_nm=The Thunder Altar
e_sunken22_a_dsc=You all feel the electricity in the air as you approach the altar, a statue of the Great Bird crackling with lightning energy. It embodies the thunderous nature of the Great Bird, symbolizing both the promise of a good rain and the wild, uncontrollable fury of thunder.<br><br>Most followers of the Great Bird find this aspect of their deity the hardest to honor, as its ever-changing mood makes the rituals unpredictable. Yet, just as thunder always finds its path, the rituals always reach the Great Bird.<br><br>The altar is guarded, and to proceed, you must show your respect to the Great Bird.
e_sunken22_a_dsca=How will you show your devotion to the Great Bird?

e_sunken22_a_rp2_s=You recall the words of the pilgrims you met shortly after arriving at the temple and follow their advice. <br><br>It turns out they were right; you don’t actually need to touch the altar; simply being close enough will do the trick. After all, most of the priestesses agree that if you approach the altar and survive, it means the Great Bird at least tolerates your presence. So, you step near the altar, wait for a few moments, and leave the area unharmed.<br><br>Although your act of devotion is simple, you feel confident it will earn you the Great Bird's tolerance, and the guards allow you to continue your pilgrimage.

Your tribute brings joy to the Great Bird.<br><br>Impressed by your devotion, the guards at the altar give you some shards and allow you to continue your pilgrimage.
e_sunken23_a_nm=The Blood Altar
e_sunken23_a_dsc=This is one of the main sites of the Great Bird cult: the Altar of Blood. Here, devotees willingly (most of the time) offer their blood to the Great Bird, as it is through blood that the Great Bird binds the fate of all Aquarfall’s creatures. Such is the people’s devotion that this altar is always crowded, with a constant flow of blood to feed the Great Bird’s ambition.<br><br>After waiting for your turn, you find yourselves before a statue of the Great Bird, flanked by two crimson crystals, its beak wide open, and nearby, ritual tools for exsanguination and a bucket.<br><br>The altar is guarded, and to continue, you must demonstrate your respect for the Great Bird.

e_sunken23_a_rp2_s=You recall the words of the pilgrims you met shortly after arriving at the temple and follow their advice.<br><br>It turns out they were right, the tools at your disposal, along with the bucket on the altar, are filled with blood that you can use to satisfy the Great Bird.

e_sunken23_a_rp3=Let’s hear if Lady Tulah has a plan.
e_sunken23_a_rp3_s=(Tulah): “The bucket is full of blood from the tools, let’s use it instead of our own blood.

e_sunken23_a_rp5=I will show you what true devotion looks like!
e_sunken23_a_rp5_s=There is only one way to show your devotion: by filling the statue until your blood overflows from the Great Bird’s beak! <br><br>You grab one of the tools and place your arm inside the statue’s beak. As your blood flows, the statue begins to glow. The glow intensifies, and it becomes hard to keep your eyes open until you finally collapse.<br><br>When you awaken, weakened by the blood loss, the guards inform you that your sacrifice has brought joy to the Great Bird and allow you all to continue your pilgrimage.
e_sunken24_a_nm=The Sacred Flame Altar
e_sunken24_a_dsc=This is the altar where the sacred flame aspect of the Great Bird is revered.

e_sunken24_a_rp2_s=You recall the words of the pilgrims you met shortly after arriving at the temple and follow their advice.<br><br>It turns out they were right, the flames are not that intense, and simply touching the statue with the tip of your fingers is enough to please the guards and priestesses.<br><br>Although your act of devotion is simple, you feel confident it will earn you the Great Bird's tolerance, and the guards allow you to continue your pilgrimage.
e_sunken24_a_rp3=Let’s hear if Lady Tulah has a plan.

For a moment, you consider dropping the statue, but the cheers of the crowd inspire you to keep holding it.<br><br>When you finally return the statue to its place, the pain in your hands subsides, yet you feel that part of your soul has been scorched by the Great Bird’s influence.

e_sunken25_a_nm=The slaves slum
e_sunken25_a_dsc=You arrive at the chamber where the enslaved cold-blooded race people live. This must be the place the naga told you about. The room is crowded, but you don’t see any guards nearby. It looks like the guards let the prisoners organize themselves in this slum.<br><br>It would be easy for you to interact with the slaves and even try to free them. To your surprise, they have all the tools for breaking their chains within reach.

For the first time in years, they feel something long forgotten: hope.<br><br>They tell you that you’re close to the Great Bird’s arena and beg you to create as much chaos there as possible, giving them a chance to escape. Grateful for your actions, the slaves gather as much gold as they can and present it to you as a token of thanks for what you are about to do.

e_sunken25_a_rp1_f=The slaves barely react to your words, even when you repeat them louder. It seems that those kinds of words are a recipe for disaster in this place.<br><br>These people are not in the mood for a revolt, and you are not going to force them, so you decide to continue your journey without insisting much more.<br><br>At least you hope that once the Great Bird has been defeated, they will take their chance to escape.

They know it isn’t much, but they want you to have it.
e_sunken25_a_rp3=Let's try to maintain a low profile while we figure out who is on our side.
e_sunken25_a_rp3_s=Some of the slaves are curious about your adventures and what life is like outside the temple. They ask you to share stories.<br><br>Their questions, however, raise your suspicions as some are very specific about the rebellion and its supporters. This makes you suspect that they might be spies for the Great Bird!<br><br>Exposing the spies earns you the trust and favor of the slaves, who now view you as reliable and share some of their belongings with your group.

e_sunken25_a_rp4=Does anybody know what this key opens?
e_sunken25_a_rp4_s=As you show the key given to you by the little lizard, a pair of elderly lizardmen rush over and demand to know why you have their child’s key.<br><br>You explain that you freed their son from the mines, and a spark of joy lights up their eyes. They guide you to their small shack, and while searching for their child’s chest, they ask you to recount in full detail how you rescued him.<br><br>Once you finish your tale, they hand you the chest. Inside, you find a collection of magical shards and some coins. They warn you that if you plan to face the Great Bird, it will likely create enough chaos for the slaves to break free, but caution you to keep this plan secret, as some slaves act as spies for the guards and could sabotage your efforts.
e_sunken25_a_rp5=There are good people among these slaves who would help us if they knew our cause.
e_sunken25_a_rp5_s=(Tulah): “There are some slaves who serve as spies for the guards. Let me talk to those I know support our cause to end the Great Bird’s reign of terror.”<br><br>Tulah moves from one group of slaves to another, talking to them. She is well received by all of the slaves. It is clear that she is doing everything she can to help these people, and they repay her with kindness. After a while, Tulah comes back with a small bag.<br><br>(Tulah): “I spoke with the slave leaders, and they are going to organize their people so they can take advantage of the chaos that our fight against the Great Bird will cause to flee. We have given them hope, and they want to pay you with this little gold pouch.”
e_sunken25_a_rp6=Lady Tulah, how can we help these people?
e_sunken25_a_rp6_s=(Tulah): “Some slaves serve as spies for the guards, but I know others who will join our cause to end the Great Bird’s reign of terror. I’ll speak to them.”<br><br>Tulah moves from one group of slaves to another, exchanging a few words before moving on. After some time, Tulah returns with a small pouch.<br><br>(Tulah): “I spoke with the slave leaders.

We’ve given them hope, and they want to thank you with this pouch of gold.”
e_sunken26_a_nm=The sacred hatchery
e_sunken26_a_dsc=In a wet and dark chamber, there is a stone statue of the Great Bird holding a bowl with some blood, from which dark energies emanate, spreading throughout the room. It would be just another statue of the Great Bird, but this time it seems to serve a darker purpose.<br><br>Hundreds of eggs of different sizes and species are scattered around the room, and they seem to be absorbing the dark energy.<br><br>There is no doubt: the Great Bird’s acolytes are corrupting these eggs for some dark purpose.
e_sunken26_a_dsca=Are you going to do anything about it?
e_sunken26_a_rp0=Just being close to that stench magic is dangerous. We should leave.
e_sunken26_a_rp0_s=The influence of the Great Bird is very strong in this place, making it extremely complicated to manipulate this magic, so you prefer to avoid any complications now that you are so close to the Great Bird.<br><br>You don’t know how damaged or influenced by the Great Bird’s magic these eggs are, and you hope that once you are done with it, the magic will stop affecting these poor creatures, already doomed before their birth.
e_sunken26_a_rp1=Let’s add more blood to fuel this evil magic!
e_sunken26_a_rp1_s=You all agree to add a little blood to the statue’s bowl, but the dark energies in the room interfere with your healing process, so the wounds you inflict to draw blood hurt more than usual and don’t seem to heal anytime soon.<br><br>But not everything is bad; as the energy from the statue intensifies, so does its effect. The statue collapses when the dark energies are at their peak, shattering into many tiny rock fragments, all imbued with powerful magic and therefore of great value as magic shards. <br><br>You gather as many of these fragments as you can.
e_sunken26_a_rp2=We should eliminate the source of that magic. Let’s demolish the statue.
e_sunken26_a_rp2_s=As you are unsure how the statue will react to the use of magic, you decide to demolish it the old-fashioned way: by bringing it down.<br><br>The statue is unable to resist the combined strength of the group, and it eventually falls and breaks with a thunderous noise.

e_sunken26_a_rp3=We should destroy the eggs. They are tainted beyond salvation.
e_sunken26_a_rp3_s=Whatever they are doing here, it is up to no good, so you decide to destroy the eggs before they become a problem.<br><br>It may be an extreme solution, but who knows what damage the creatures born from these eggs may cause.<br><br>Even if some of you feel bad for this merciless act, you try to find solace in the idea that it has been for the greater good.

e_sunken26_a_rp4=Let's clean it up and use that magic to bring our unfinished stone construct to life.
e_sunken26_a_rp4_s=It’s clear that this magic is used to infuse dark energies into the eggs, and you're certain this is how they animate their stone constructs.<br><br>You all focus on making it work with the stone construct you stole from the stonemasonry workshop, and to your surprise, it’s quite easy to make the adjustment you want.<br><br>The Great Bird's magic bends to your will, and soon enough, your new companion awakens! The stone construct seems to recognize you as the object of its protection and is eager to defend and serve you!
e_sunken26_a_rp5=It is powering the eggs. I want that power for myself!
e_sunken26_a_rp5_s=Zek redirects the magic from the statue to himself. It is a risky move, but Zek is deeply committed to his quest for power!<br><br>At first, it seems Zek is unable to absorb all that magic at once, but slowly he stabilizes the energy and manages to siphon all the power from the statue.<br><br>The room is no longer filled with dark magic, and Zek, though exhausted, claims that the experience has enhanced his mind. You are not sure what he means, but at least the Great Bird’s influence over the eggs is gone, and Zek seems satisfied.

It is a risky move, but Zek is deeply committed to his quest for power!<br><br>Unfortunately for him, the magic from the Great Bird’s statue is too pure for him to siphon properly, and he can’t handle it.<br><br>The ratman reluctantly accepts his defeat and urges you to continue, leaving this place as it is, claiming that it is not worth losing your time here. Zek rushes out of the chamber, and you have to run to catch up with him.
e_sunken26_a_rp6=There are eggs of my kind among these. We must protect them!
e_sunken26_a_rp6_s=Thuls is determined to help all the eggs by any means, and he climbs the statue and empties the contents of one of his little pouches into the bowl.<br><br>He explains to you that he just used a magical powder he saves for emergencies when he needs to nullify the effects of his target’s magic. It is an important asset in his line of work.<br><br>He also tells you that the effects won’t last long, but hopefully it will be enough to make the Great Bird pay for all the damage it is causing to the cold-blooded races. Thuls urges you to hurry and find the Great Bird as soon as possible!
e_sunken26_a_rp6_f=Thuls is determined to help all the eggs by any means, and he climbs the statue and empties the contents of one of his little pouches into the bowl.<br><br>He explains to you that he just used a magical powder he saves for emergencies when he needs to nullify the effects of his target’s magic, but the magic of the bowl is more powerful than his powder, and the eggs are beyond salvation now.<br><br>Nonetheless, Thuls asks you not to destroy these eggs, as he believes that the tainted breed that will hatch from them deserves a chance to live too. Disappointed at not being able to save the eggs from corruption, but determined to make the Great Bird pay for all the harm it has caused his people, Thuls urges you to continue.
e_sunken27_a_nm=The Great Bird Thunder Arena
e_sunken27_a_dsc=In the center of a vast arena stands an altar crackling with energy, surrounded by glittering treasures.

Such is the overwhelming power of the Great Bird.<br><br>As you draw closer to the altar, a sudden lightning strike crashes down, blinding you momentarily. When your vision returns, you see it: the Great Bird, magnificent and imposing, in all its glory. Its gaze locks onto you, piercing deep into your soul, silently passing judgment.<br><br>There is no escape, no place to hide.

e_sunken27_a_rp0_s=The Great Bird is angry with you, and you’re not giving it time to prepare! <br><br>Clearly, the Great Bird underestimated how quickly you could close the gap to its position, expecting to have more time to prepare its offense.

e_sunken27_c_rp8_s=A joyful the Great Bird is watching your moves,  but your flanking maneuver is perfectly executed, and the winged creature is unable to counter it.<br><br>Thanks to your tactical superiority, you begin the fight with a strong advantage over the Great Bird.
e_sunken27_c_rp8_sc=rptd_e_sunken27_a_rp8_sc
e_sunken27_c_rp8_f=The Great Bird is joyful, but vigilant of your moves, so for your flanking maneuver to succeed, it must be flawlessly executed.<br><br>Unfortunately, that is not the case, as the Great Bird conjures sacred fire walls that slow you down. <br><br>Although you manage to avoid injury from the fire, the Great Bird repositions and takes advantage of the situation.
e_sunken27_c_rp8_fc=The Great Bird is joyful, but vigilant of your moves, so for your flanking maneuver to succeed, it must be flawlessly executed.<br><br>Unfortunately, that is not the case, as the Great Bird conjures sacred fire walls that slow you down. <br><br>You are unable to evade the flames, and though their effects last only a moment, you all still feel the burning inside you for far too long. The Great Bird strikes before you have time to recover.
e_sunken27_c1_nm=The extinguished flame
e_sunken27_c1_dsc=The Great Bird is defeated and vanishes in a pillar of sacred flames that momentarily mesmerizes you with its glorious power. <br><br>Even at this depth, you can hear the turmoil caused by its sudden disappearance in the upper levels of the temple. It’s clear that nothing here will be the same after today. The Great Bird’s cult will collapse without its powerful benefactor, and someone else will take their place. <br><br>The young snake that accompanied you has made herself comfortable on the remains of the Great Bird’s altar. It seems she has found a new home.

e_sunken28_a_nm=The farewell
e_sunken28_a_dsc=After the defeat of the Great Bird, a portal similar to the one that brought you here appears nearby, and you all feel compelled to cross it. <br><br>Your last thought before crossing the portal is of the cold-blooded races of Aquarfall. You hope they can have a better life from now on.
e_sunken28_a_dsca=That is how your adventure in the past ends.
e_sunken28_a_rp0=We are finally back to present Aquarfall.
e_sunken28_a_rp0_s=After crossing the portal and recovering from the dizziness caused by that type of travel, you all take some time to gather your thoughts. After the rebellion against the Great Bird and its cult, the naga rose to leadership among the cold-blooded races and ended up oppressing the other races. <br><br>However, without the support of a creature like the Great Bird, their control was not absolute, and their rule eventually crumbled, along with the temple they used as their seat of power, leading to the Aquarfall you know. <br><br>Unfortunately, you didn’t find any trace of the priestess who originally made the rebellion triumph, but you hope that, thanks to your intervention, her sacrifice will no longer be necessary.
e_sunken28_a_rp1=Sss... So, this is how it started.
e_sunken28_a_rp1_s=(Thuls): "Sss... I never thought I would experience how my people earned their freedom. After the Great Bird, we had to live under the naga regime, but alongside the crocomen, we waged war against the naga and won.<br><br>We hold ritual fights with the crocomen to commemorate that event. Aquarfall should never suffer under a tyrant like the Great Bird again.<br><br>I hope my people never forget how costly it was for us to gain our freedom."
e_sunken28_a_rp2=It was even more terrible than the stories I had heard.
e_sunken28_a_rp2_s=(Malukah): "The followers of the Great Bird crossed every line and made all the races from the swamp hate humans, so most were forced to flee Aquarfall after the Great Bird's defeat.<br><br>Their culture was scattered around the world, and for the children of the swamp, like me, the Great Bird was just a tale our parents told us when we misbehaved.<br><br>Now that I have seen how terrible it was, I am glad it's over. I understand why there is so much hatred for it, and I hope Aquarfall will never suffer under another tyrant like the Great Bird again."
e_sunken28_a_rp3=The Great Bird was terrifying. I’m glad we defeated it.
e_sunken28_a_rp3_s=(Bree): “I have seen firsthand what nature’s corruption looks like, and I wonder if the Great Bird was acting that way because its soul was corrupted by something, or if it was simply an evil creature. I don’t believe there is evil in nature; it must have been something else.<br><br>Although I understand that nature has its rules and it’s better not to interfere with them, I feel we did the right thing.<br><br>I believe the lessons we learned from this experience will help me better understand the rules of nature.”
e_sunken28_a_rp4=It looks like everything is fine on this side of the rift.
e_sunken28_a_rp4_s=(Amelia): “The rift’s magic is dangerous and can produce chaotic outcomes, but I would say we managed the situation well.<br><br>Our intervention didn’t alter the main events of the revolt: The Great Bird was defeated, and the naga will take the lead of their cold-blooded races alliance. However, they will eventually become tyrants, and their alliance will break. But that’s another story.<br><br>I must admit I would have liked to meet the priestess who started all of this, but I guess that will have to wait for another time.”
e_sunken28_a_rp5=This reminds me something.
e_sunken28_a_rp5_s=(Navalea): “So, the godlike creature that everyone adored turned out to be a cruel tyrant, huh? I know that story well.<br><br>I pity the Great Bird’s followers, as I’m sure they truly believed they were doing the right thing.<br><br>Over the years, I’ve learned that the most fearsome skill of godlike creatures like the Great Bird, or even Basthet herself, isn’t the power they hold but the way they shape how their followers perceive the world, leaving them unable to distinguish between good and evil. I’m glad we put an end to that madness.”
e_sunken28_a_rp6=Basthet wouldn’t allow this to happen.
e_sunken28_a_rp6_s=(Laia): “To me, it’s clear that the Great Bird didn’t care about its followers, not like my beloved Basthet!<br><br>I hope the Great Bird’s followers seek Basthet’s enlightenment, as it’s evident she is far wiser than that cruel, winged creature. My goddess will surely guide them along the path to redemption.<br><br>Besides, it was only natural for us to strike the Great Bird down; after all, you know the relationship between felines and birds!”
e_sunken28_a_rp7=Croak... Now I understand better the people of Aquarfall.
e_sunken28_a_rp7_s=(Gustav): “I wasn’t raised in Aquarfall, and I never really understood why its people were so divided. Now I think I understand.<br><br>Croak... The crocomen and the lizardmen usually engage in ritual fights against each other, although they’re at peace most of the time. But the naga... those guys are always causing trouble! They believe Aquarfall belongs to them!<br><br>Now that I think about it... there are barely any humans left in Aquarfall. I wonder where they went... Croak.”
e_sunken28_a_rp8=Experiencing history is always exciting!
e_sunken28_a_rp8_s=(Wilbur): “After this event, the naga, led by Shn’anke the Meek, united all the cold-blooded races under their banner and hunted down the humans who refused to leave Aquarfall. The lizardmen and the crocomen were especially concerned that Shn’anke and his followers were even more cruel than the Great Bird’s cult and attempted to depose him.<br><br>Shn’anke, by then known as the Cruel, and his naga fought against every other race in Aquarfall. The Sunken Temple was largely destroyed and abandoned as a consequence of that war. The cold-blooded races never united under the same banner again.<br><br>It has been an enlightening experience to stand in the very place where the fate of Aquarfall was decided.”
e_sunken28_b_nm=The farewell!
e_sunken28_b_dsc=After the defeat of the Great Bird, a portal similar to the one that brought you here appears nearby, and you all feel compelled to cross it. <br><br>The conflict within Tulah is evident, as she hesitates over whether to cross the rift with you or not. It is a decision she must make on her own. Just as you are about to reach the breach, Tulah rushes through it before you do. It seems she has decided to help you in your world as you helped her in hers!
e_sunken28_b_dsca=That is how your adventure in the past ends.
e_sunken28_b_rp0=We are finally back to present Aquarfall, with Tulah!
e_sunken28_b_rp0_s=After crossing the portal and recovering from the dizziness caused by that type of travel, you all take some time to gather your thoughts. After the rebellion against the Great Bird and its cult, the naga rose to leadership among the cold-blooded races and ended up oppressing the other races. <br><br>However, without the support of a creature like the Great Bird, their control was not absolute, and their rule eventually crumbled, along with the temple they used as their seat of power, leading to the Aquarfall you know. <br><br>Tulah is surprised to discover how things turned out for Aquarfall, and she tells you that's not what she wanted. She also wonders what would have happened to her in that case, for allowing her sacrifice to cause even more suffering, this time at the naga's hands.

e_sunken28_b_rp3_s=You tell Tulah that in your timeline, after the defeat of the Great Bird, the naga tried to enslave the other races, and it was only through the cooperation of the lizardmen and crocomen that they were stopped. Tulah is shocked by this information.<br><br>(Tulah): "So even my sacrifice wouldn’t have been enough to prevent that fate? The leaders of the revolt against the Great Bird were naga! I feel betrayed. Why is it so hard to help those in need?<br><br>Did we save my world from that destiny? I guess I will never know. At least let me help you make yours a better place."

e_sunken2_a_dsc=You arrive at the Zealot's Chamber, a room where pilgrims can rest before continuing their journey into the temple's depths.<br><br>An elderly couple asks your group if this is your first pilgrimage and offers some advice. They mention that they have made this journey annually for many years and know the secrets of all the altars: Golden, Spirits, Thunder, Sacred Flame, and Blood.<br><br>It seems this couple simply wants to share their wisdom with fellow pilgrims.
e_sunken2_a_dsca=Will you listen to what they have to say about any of the altars?
e_sunken2_a_rp0=Thank you but we are in a hurry.
e_sunken2_a_rp0_s=The elderly couple smiles when you tell them you're in a hurry, and they say they miss the days when they were young and always rushing.<br><br>They begin reminiscing about how different things were in their youth, but you are long gone before they can finish their story.
e_sunken2_a_rp1=What can you tell us about the Golden Altar?
e_sunken2_a_rp1_s=The couple tells you that the original purpose of the Golden Altar was to celebrate the arrival of the Great Bird, which was seen as a sunbeam of hope for the people of Aquarfall. However, nowadays, people honor the Great Bird there in the hope that it will bring them fortune and material wealth.<br><br>Those who remember the true story leave some gold near the altar, always in the smaller pile, for others who may need it. As long as you take only what you need, you are free to collect some gold from there.<br><br>After sharing the story of the Golden Altar, the couple decides to retire and rest before continuing their journey. You bid them farewell and continue exploring the temple.
e_sunken2_a_rp2=What do you know about the Spirit Altar?
e_sunken2_a_rp2_s=The couple tells you that the purpose of the Spirit Altar is to celebrate the fact that the Great Bird taught the natives of Aquarfall how to properly use magic, as before its arrival, their magic was crude and unrefined.<br><br>It is a tradition to offer magical shards of solidified magic to the Great Bird's statue. These shards are difficult to craft and expensive, but if you need some for your offering, the couple suggests looking at the ground around the altar, as there are plenty scattered there!<br><br>After sharing the story of the Spirit Altar, the couple decides to retire and rest before continuing their journey. You bid them farewell and continue exploring the temple.
e_sunken2_a_rp3=The Thunder Altar sounds interesting. What do you know about it?
e_sunken2_a_rp3_s=The couple tells you that the Thunder Altar is a place to honor the good omens the Great Bird brings to the people of Aquarfall.<br><br>They explain that the thunder aspect was once a test of valor and devotion for their ancestors, as they had to stand touching the altar for a whole day without being struck by lightning. Nowadays, however, you don’t even need to touch the altar! Simply standing close to it for a moment is enough. The couple then rants for a while about how the priests have become too lenient with their rituals.<br><br>After sharing the story of the Thunder Altar and voicing their complaints about the new rituals, the couple decides to retire and rest before continuing their journey. You bid them farewell and continue exploring the temple.
e_sunken2_a_rp4=We are intrigued by the Sacred Flame Altar. What can you tell us about it?
e_sunken2_a_rp4_s=The couple smiles when you ask about the Sacred Flame Altar, as they tell you it is the most spectacular of the Great Bird’s altars. The elders of Aquarfall were amazed by the Great Bird’s sacred flame, which burns its enemies and comforts its followers. It is said that thanks to this fire, the people were able to follow the Great Bird through the darkest nights.<br><br>The elderly couple explains that this is a favorite story of the priests. The Great Bird is like a peacock, but instead of feathers, its tail is made of flames, and the flames at its altar are just for display. They also mention that you could touch the statue at the altar with your fingertips without being burned!<br><br>After sharing the story of the Sacred Flame Altar, the couple decides to retire and rest before continuing their journey. You bid them farewell and continue exploring the temple.
e_sunken2_a_rp5=The Blood Altar sounds important. What do you know about it?
e_sunken2_a_rp5_s=The couple is delighted that you asked about the Blood Altar, as it is undeniably the most significant altar in the Great Bird’s cult. According to its teachings, blood serves as the ultimate connection between all things, which is why it holds such a central role in the Great Bird’s rituals.<br><br>The elderly couple explains that for those uncomfortable with the sight of blood, there are ways to make an offering to the Great Bird’s statue with minimal distress. For instance, you can use the dried blood from the tools near the altar! They emphasize that what many fail to understand is that all blood is valuable to the Great Bird, it doesn’t matter whether it is yours or someone else’s.<br><br>After sharing the story of the Blood Altar, the couple decides to rest before continuing their journey. You bid them farewell and resume exploring the temple.
e_sunken3_a_nm=The beggar’s gossip
e_sunken3_a_dsc=At the side of the chamber, you find a beggar who is telling everyone who passes by that he knows the secret entrance the guards use to kidnap people without anyone noticing.<br><br>The people who pass near him try to avoid eye contact, and the guards seem to ignore him.<br><br>It is a dangerous topic, and the only reason he may still be alive is because he’s either crazy or just a liar, but it might be interesting to hear what he has to say.
e_sunken3_a_dsca=Will you listen to the beggar?
e_sunken3_a_rp0=We don’t have time for crazy beggars.
e_sunken3_a_rp0_s=You decide to continue your journey, doing as everyone else, avoiding eye contact with the beggar.<br><br>As you pass by him, you hear him laughing frantically.
e_sunken3_a_rp1=Let’s give him 240g and see what he knows.
e_sunken3_a_rp1_s=You are experienced adventurers and know that no reliable information comes free, so you approach the beggar and offer him 240g to share his knowledge.<br><br>The beggar is both surprised and pleased that there are still some sensible people around the temple. He tells you that the side ladder that gives access to the temple is precarious on purpose, but when the guards want to kidnap someone into the temple, they use an additional, magically hidden ladder that they uncover using an enchanted feather.<br><br>The beggar gives you one of these enchanted feathers and tells you to check it for yourselves!
e_sunken3_a_rp2=We may convince him to tell us what he knows.
e_sunken3_a_rp2_s=It’s clear that the beggar wants to talk, so you only need to show that you’re eager to listen. You ask him about the secret entrance.<br><br>He reveals that the dangerous side ladder leading to the temple is used by the guards to kidnap people at night. Additionally, they use a magically concealed rope, which they uncover with the help of an enchanted feather.<br><br>The beggar hands you one of these enchanted feathers and urges you to see for yourselves!
e_sunken3_a_rp2_sc=It’s clear that the beggar wants to talk, so you only need to show that you’re eager to listen. You ask him about the secret entrance.<br><br>He reveals that the dangerous side ladder leading to the temple is used by the guards to kidnap people at night. They also rely on a magically concealed rope, which they uncover using an enchanted feather.<br><br>The beggar, pleased by your company, gives you some gold and one of the enchanted feathers, urging you to investigate the ladder for yourselves!
e_sunken3_a_rp2_f=It is clear that the beggar wants to talk, so you just need to show him that you are eager to listen. You ask him about the secret entrance.<br><br>The beggar didn’t expect that someone would listen to him, and he is overly pleased when your group asks him questions about what he is saying.<br><br>After listening to him for what feels like hours, you realize that he has nothing interesting to say and leave, feeling that you have wasted some precious time.
e_sunken3_a_rp2_fc=It is clear that the beggar wants to talk, so you just need to show him that you are eager to listen. You ask him about the secret entrance.<br><br>The beggar didn’t expect that someone would listen to him, and he is overly pleased when your group asks him questions about what he is saying.<br><br>After listening to him for what feels like hours without hearing anything remotely useful, you wonder what you were thinking when you decided to listen to what this madman had to say. You leave, feeling a little ashamed for not seeing through this nonsense.
e_sunken3_a_rp3=Actually, what this man is saying is true.
e_sunken3_a_rp3_s=(Tulah): "The guards let him talk because they know that if they arrest him, someone else will come along saying the same things. They prefer to leave him alone and ignore him, even though what he's saying is true.<br><br>It also serves as a reminder to the people that the guards commit those despicable acts to appease the Great Bird's bloodlust. We should continue our journey and not worry about him; that man has found safety in his feigned madness."<br><br>You follow Tulah’s advice and continue exploring the temple. It seems Tulah knows what she's doing.
e_sunken3_a_rp4=This man speaks the truth. We should listen to him.
e_sunken3_a_rp4_s=You do as Nezglek advises and get close to the beggar, telling him that you believe what he is saying.<br><br>The beggar is both surprised and pleased that there are still some sensible people around the temple. He tells you that the side ladder giving access to the temple is precarious on purpose, but when the guards want to kidnap someone into the temple, they use an additional, magically hidden ladder that they uncover with an enchanted feather.<br><br>The beggar says he enjoyed your company very much and gives you one of the enchanted feathers, telling you to check the ladder for yourselves!
e_sunken3_a_rp5=You’re going to tell me what you know, buddy.
e_sunken3_a_rp5_s=(Yogger): “You’d better tell me what you know, and it had better be true, or I might get angry, buddy. And you don’t want to see me angry.”<br><br>The beggar is intimidated by Yogger and tells you, in a trembling voice, that the guards use an enchanted feather to reveal a hidden rope ladder near the auxiliary entrance. They use it to avoid activating the great elevator at night. He offers to give you one of those feathers so you can try it for yourselves if Yogger lets him go.<br><br>(Yogger): “I accept. Now give me the feather, and all the gold you gathered today, too. See? I’m a reasonable werewolf. Now get out of my sight.”
e_sunken3_a_rp6=Sss…  Tell me what you know.
e_sunken3_a_rp6_s=(Thuls): "Sss... I won’t hesitate to kill you if you lie to me. Choose your words carefully."<br><br>The beggar smiles kindly at Thuls and tells him he understands how the lizardman feels, as most of the people the guards kidnap this way are lizardmen. He explains that the guards use an enchanted feather to reveal a hidden rope ladder near the auxiliary entrance, which they use to avoid activating the great elevator at night.<br><br>The man hands Thuls one of these feathers and warns him that what he will discover there will not please him. Thuls nods slowly, with a determination never seen before in the lizardman’s eyes.
e_sunken4_a_nm=The slaves market
e_sunken4_a_dsc=You arrive at the market, but instead of merchants, you find only guards and their prisoners.<br><br>The leader of the guards informs you that they have just suppressed a slave revolt here and that you may continue your pilgrimage to the altars, although the merchants won’t be returning anytime soon.<br><br>Among the chained people are crocomen, nagas, and lizardmen. These must be some of the prisoners the naga mentioned when you arrived through the portal. You notice that some of them are discreetly hiding the fact that they are free from their chains, seemingly preparing for an escape.
e_sunken4_a_dsca=Will you continue your journey or help them?
e_sunken4_a_rp0=We better continue our journey.
e_sunken4_a_rp0_s=Things are about to get chaotic with this group of prisoners, so you decide to continue your journey before you get involved in something you can't escape from.
e_sunken4_a_rp1=We should inform the guards that the prisoners appear to be plotting something.
e_sunken4_a_rp1_s=You inform the guards that some of the prisoners' chains appear to be loose. The guards check them, and it is indeed true. The prisoners have no chance, and their escape attempt fails before it even begins.<br><br>The captain of the guard thanks you for your help and gives you a colored feather. He explains that it will grant you access to the deeper parts of the temple if you wish to proceed to the greater altars.<br><br>You continue your journey, trying to avoid looking at the chained prisoners.
e_sunken4_a_rp2=Let’s help these prisoners escape!
e_sunken4_a_rp2_s=You look at the prisoners, and when they meet your gaze, you nod. Before the guards can react, you push the captain to the ground.<br><br>While the guards rush to help their leader, the prisoners strike from behind, quickly knocking their captors unconscious.<br><br>Before the prisoners leave, they tell you where to find the rest of their group, still imprisoned in the temple. They also say that for them to trust you, you will need to use the secret catchphrase: “Today, the bird will be hungry.”
e_sunken4_a_rp2_sc=You look at the prisoners, and when they meet your gaze, you nod. Before the guards can react, you shove the captain to the ground.<br><br>As the guards rush to assist their leader, the prisoners attack from behind, swiftly knocking their captors unconscious.<br><br>You immediately start looting the unconscious guards before resuming your journey, while the slaves begin their escape. Before all the slaves have left, one of them tells you that if you go to the slave slums, you can use the secret phrase, “Today the bird will be hungry,” so the others will know you are on their side.
e_sunken4_a_rp2_f=You push the captain, trying to create an opportunity for the prisoners to escape, but you are unable to take him down.<br><br>The other guards join him, and when the prisoners no longer have guards watching over them, they begin to flee. Before escaping, one of the prisoners tells you to use the catchphrase, “Today the bird will be hungry,” if you meet their friends in the depths of the temple.<br><br>The guards hesitate between chasing the prisoners or arresting you, but you place yourselves between the prisoners' escape route and them, resulting in a fight with the captain and his guards.
e_sunken4_a_rp2_fc=You push the captain, trying to create an opportunity for the prisoners to escape, but you are unable to take him down.<br><br>The other guards join him, and when the prisoners no longer have guards watching over them, they begin to flee. Before escaping, one of the prisoners tells you to use the catchphrase, “Today the bird will be hungry,” if you meet their friends in the depths of the temple.<br><br>The captain orders the guards to focus on arresting you, as they will hunt the escaped slaves later. You can feel that they are determined to use any means necessary to subdue you!

e_aquar48_c1_nm=The old research camp
e_aquar48_c1_dsc=In the middle of the mangroves, you come across an old research camp. It seems to have been abandoned long ago, and the equipment is too deteriorated to be of any use. However, among the remnants of the tents, you spot a crest that looks familiar.<br><br>It resembles the crest you found in Senenthia, but it is not an exact match.

e_aquar48_c1_rp1=This is it. This is the symbol of the crest we found.
e_aquar48_c1_rp1_s=There are notable similarities between the crest you discovered in Senenthia and the symbols on the tents.<br><br>Based on the information you’ve gathered, this was a research camp established by the Merwin family, a branch of the Casthak noble house dedicated to the study of alchemy. They came to Aquarfall in search of exotic reagents, but, according to the few legible notes found in the camp, they departed due to the hostile fauna.<br><br>While reading the notes, you recognize the ingenuity of their hypothesis and how close they came to discovering something significant.<br><br>The research notes open your minds to new perspectives.
e_aquar48_c1_rp2=This is nonsense. Let’s disenchant the emblem and scavenge the camp.
e_aquar48_c1_rp2_s=You all agree that the crest is likely a trivial trinket not worth the effort, so you decide to disenchant it to create some magical shards instead.<br><br>While some of you work on disenchanting the emblem, the rest of the group searches the camp, salvaging anything useful.<br><br>You manage to gather a small amount of gold and shards.

e_ulmin6_b2_rp5_s=(Laia): "That story dates back to before I was enlightened by Basthet’s grace.

e_faen30_b1_dsc=While traversing the frozen city, the symbol on the door of one of the houses catches your attention.<br><br>The design resembles the crest you found in Senenthia, though it is not an exact match.

e_faen30_b1_rp1=rptd_e_aquar48_c1_rp1
e_faen30_b1_rp1_s=There are notable similarities between the crest you discovered in Senenthia and the symbols on the door, so you decide to break into the house in search of information about the crest.<br><br>Inside, you discover that the building belongs to House Ferbert, a branch of House Casthak specializing in diplomacy and politics. You find some documents and information about prominent figures in Faeborgnian society, but given the current situation, this information is useless to your group.<br><br>It seems they were working on building a trustworthy relationship between the people of Senenthia and Faeborg. For some reason, this makes you reflect on the importance of being a reliable ally, and you wonder if help from Senenthia is on its way to Faeborg.

e_voidlow4_b_nm=The book of heraldry
e_voidlow4_b_dsc=Amid the debris of what appears to be an ancient building, a faint spark catches your eye. It seems the magical aura protecting a book has successfully preserved this particular volume and its nearby treasures from the erosion of time.<br><br>Unfortunately, the same magical aura prevents you from touching the book.<br><br>Only when you notice that the crest you discovered in Senenthia is glowing with a similar light do you understand: the answer to the crest's mystery lies within that book.
e_voidlow4_b_dsca=At last, we can solve the mystery!
e_voidlow4_b_rp0=Let’s put the emblem and the book together and see what happens.
e_voidlow4_b_rp0_s=When you place them together, the energy from the book is absorbed by the emblem, deactivating the shield protecting the book and allowing you to read it.<br><br>The book details the emblems of noble houses that fought in the Archon Wars. This crest belongs to House Ader.<br><br>House Ader was a beloved house that achieved several key victories in the war against the Archons. Through their leadership, those who fought alongside them were able to overcome any adversity.<br><br>Unfortunately, the house was exterminated in a battle where they chose to fight the enemy to buy time for their allies to escape. Those saved that day, thanks to House Ader’s sacrifice, incorporated part of Ader’s crest into their own to honor the act.<br><br>The most prominent house to adopt this tradition was House Casthak. Over time, however, its meaning was forgotten.<br><br>Before leaving, you gather some resources that were also protected by the book’s shield. 
e_voidlow4_b_rp1=We can open the book with the emblem. I know this mechanism.
e_voidlow4_b_rp1_s=(Amelia): “This book is fascinating.

e_aquar49_a_dsc=You are walking on the wooden bridge when you hear a soft buzz. You stand on guard, waiting for enemies to appear, but instead of foes, a rift opens in the middle of the bridge.<br><br>The magic emanating from this portal feels different from what you are used to, and rather than a gate to another place, it seems like a portal to another time.<br><br>Upon closer inspection, you can see a temple on the other side of the rift in a very familiar setting.
e_aquar49_a_dsca=Would you like to cross the rift?
e_aquar49_a_rp0=It’s a new place to explore. Let’s go!
e_aquar49_a_rp0_s=As the great adventurers you are, you decide to jump into the rift in case it closes.<br><br>Before you realize it, you are on the other side, and although you feel a little dizzy, you recognize this place.

e_woods4_nm=The hooded vendor
e_woods4_dsc=You stumble upon a crooked little tent frayed at the edges, yet swaying in the still air.

e_woods5_a_dsc=The swamp ahead is smothered in dense fog, thick enough to chew. From the haze, harsh voices echo.

e_woods4_rp2_sc=Your charm works like magic. The merchant claps his hands with delight.<br><br>“I like you, sparkly souls. Half off... my bones will regret it.”

e_woods5_b_nm=The sickly swamp
e_woods5_b_dsc=You arrive at a swamp, where bloated monster corpses drift lazily across the surface like grotesque lillies.<br><br>A narrow path of slick stones offers passage. One wrong step, and you'll be swimming with the dead.<br><br>You could risk wading through the filth to scavenge for something useful... But whatever did this might not be far behind.
e_woods5_b_dsca=What do you want to do?
e_woods6_nm=The haunted battlefield
e_woods6_dsc=You arrive at the ruins of a haunted battlefield. This must be the place Laia spoke of.<br><br>As you step into the hushed center, ghostly figures drift from the shadows. The restless souls of long-fallen architects gather around you, silently guiding you forward.
e_woods6_dsca=To complete Basthet's trial, you must ring the silver bell given to you by Laia three times at the heart of this haunted ground.
e_woods8_nm=The cemetery gates
e_woods8_dsc=You emerge from the swamp, only to find yourself before the towering iron gates of a long-forgotten cemetery. A massive padlock hangs from the center, its keyhole wide and hungry.<br><br>Through the rusted bars, you spot something glinting deep within an open grave. But the gate won't budge, and there's no other way in.<br><br>There's a winding path nearby that could take you forward, though it leads away from the cemetery entirely.
e_woods8_dsca=The only way through the gate is with the key or by picking the lock, if you're bold (or foolish) enough to try.
e_woods9_nm=Circle of dread
e_woods9_dsc=Etched into the ground before you is a massive pentagram, carved deep and pulsing with dark energy.<br><br>You feel it in your bones that stepping inside won't kill you, but it will change you.
e_woods9_dsca=Do you dare step into the circle?
e_woods12_nm=Strange sounds
e_woods12_dsc=You find yourself before the yawning mouth of a cave. It breathes cold air from somewhere far, far below.<br><br>A mechanical buzzing hums from the depths, layered with strange clicks and whirs. It's not natural. It's not right.
e_woods12_dsca=You sense a dangerous presence in the cave, but it's too late to turn back now.
e_woods13_nm=Pet dealer
e_woods13_dsc=From afar, you spot a peculiar witch blocking the path, standing beside a wobbling cart. Inside the cart: a large, rusted cage writhing with strange, wide-eyed creatures. They chirp and gurgle, curious and slightly unnerving.<br><br>You approach, weapons ready, but the witch lifts a hand and grins:<br><br>“Peace, adventurers! I haven't hexed a soul in weeks.<br><br>What I do have is a fine selection of rare companions. Loyal, bite-sized, and only a little cursed.<br><br>Or, for just a modest sum of 1200 gold, I can make your pet stronger.
e_woods13_dsca=So? What do you say?"
e_woods14_a_nm=The withering tree
e_woods14_a_dsc=You find yourself standing before a massive, withered, ancient yet otherworldly tree. Its bark looks brittle, like one touch might turn it to dust.<br><br>Tucked inside its hollow core are flickering candles and fresh offerings of fruit.<br><br>And beneath your feet, the soil hums with quiet magic.
e_woods14_a_dsca=What will you do?
e_woods14_b_nm=The withering tree
e_woods14_b_dsc=You find yourself standing before a massive, withered, ancient yet otherworldly tree. Its bark looks brittle, like one touch might turn it to dust.<br><br>Tucked inside its hollow core are flickering candles and fresh offerings of fruit.<br><br>And beneath your feet, the soil hums with quiet magic. This seems like the perfect place to plant Ylmer's seed that has been entrusted to you.
e_woods14_b_dsca=What will you do?
e_woods15_nm=A place to rest
e_woods15_dsc=You stumble upon a makeshift camp, a ring of empty tents flapping lazily in the wind. No voices, no footsteps. Just silence.<br><br>In the distance, the castle looms. Its gates rise like jaws, the only path into the vast, brooding courtyard.<br><br>That's your destination.
e_woods15_dsca=But this camp… it might offer a moment's peace before continuing.
e_woods16_nm=Franky's lab
e_woods16_dsc=Up ahead looms a massive metal door, slightly ajar. There's no path around it, only forward.<br><br>You slip through the gap and step into a strange underground lab. Wires snake across the floor, jars bubble with unknown fluids, and machines blink with eerie life.<br><br> Then, a low growl. A towering creature lurches from the shadows, flesh stitched to metal, eyes burning with fury.<br><br>You've found his secret. And he does not appreciate guests.
e_woods16_dsca=He roars at you menacingly.
e_woods17_nm=Sleeping guards
e_woods17_dsc=You finally reach the castle gates. They are clearly unlocked, and the guards are... fast asleep?
e_woods17_dsca=There's only one thing to do.
e_woods18_nm=Just a little farther
e_woods18_dsc=At last, you spot a faint light dancing in the distance. You follow it until the cave narrows and opens into the world above. Farther ahead, you see a resting place.
e_woods18_dsca=Just a little farther. Then, you can finally breathe.
e_woods20_nm=A grave investment
e_woods20_dsc=You arrive at the grave you glimpsed from the cemetery entrance. The glinting object was a shovel jammed firmly into the earth. Someone had started digging here, but left the job unfinished.<br><br>You pick up the shovel and carry on the work. Before long, gold and trinkets begin to emerge from the soil. This grave wasn't a resting place, it was a hiding spot!<br><br>Your shovel strikes something solid. With some effort, you pull free a rune-marked chest. It's sealed shut, so it refuses to budge without the proper key.
e_woods20_dsca=So unless you have the key, you settle for the rest of the treasure.
e_woods21_nm=A place to rest
e_woods21_dsc=You find a lonesome storage shed. No sign of life. Just cobwebs, crates, and a strange stillness.<br><br>It might not be cozy, but it's cover. 
e_woods21_dsca=This could be a good place to rest and recover your strength.
e_court2_nm=Loot and scoot
e_court2_dsc=You slip into the castle armory, careful not to make a sound.<br><br>Four neatly arranged sections of gear catch your eye. These could prove useful.With a bit of luck, you might even find something rare.<br><br>But time is short. Linger too long, and someone might notice you're here. You can only check one section.
e_court2_dsca=Which section do you choose?
e_court3_nm=The annoyed blacksmith
e_court3_dsc=You come across a blacksmith hammering away at an anvil. He pauses to glare at a bat circling above, muttering a curse under his breath. As you approach, he eyes you warily and says:<br><br>“The guards were sleeping again, weren't they? I should report you to the Count, but I'm too busy dealing with this flying menace while getting my work done.<br><br>By the way, I'm a master at forging magical items. Here, take this platinum ring. But if you've got a rare material, I could craft you something even more impressive.”
e_court3_dsca=Do you have something worth forging?
e_court4_nm=Scrolls and scripts
e_court4_dsc=You step into a dust-choked chamber lined with a massive stone shelf, its weight bowed under ancient tomes. Scrolls and parchment litter the floor, faded fragments of centuries-old vampire research.<br><br>Most of the books are written in scripts you can't read, and others spiral into maddening complexity.<br><br>Still, after some digging, you uncover a handful of scrolls that might prove useful.
e_court4_dsca=What will you do?
e_court6_a_nm=Dr. Jekyll's laboratory
e_court6_a_dsc=You stumble upon a strange laboratory. At the entrance, a squid-headed figure in a lab coat adjusts his goggles and turns to you.<br><br>“Ah, travelers! I am Dr. Jekyll, lead and only researcher of this facility, dedicated to the study of the extraordinary capabilities of vampires. I suspect you're not meant to be here... but that's none of my concern.<br><br>My research is at a frustrating halt while I await some essential supplies. Still, perhaps I can offer you a glimpse into my work. Knowledge is power, yes, but it always comes at a price."
e_court6_a_dsca=What do you want to do?
e_court6_b_nm=Dr. Jekyll's laboratory
e_court6_b_dsc=You stumble upon a strange laboratory. At the entrance, a squid-headed figure in a lab coat adjusts his goggles and turns to you.<br><br>“Ah, travelers! I am Dr. Jekyll, lead and only researcher of this facility, dedicated to the study of the extraordinary capabilities of vampires. You must be hear for my delivery, yes?"
e_court6_b_dsca=Did you bring the package?
e_court6_c_nm=Dr. Jekyll's laboratory
e_court6_c_dsc=You stumble upon a strange laboratory. Nezglekt steps forward, waving to another squid-headed figure in a lab coat.<br><br>He explains to you that he occasionally assists Dr. Jekyll with his research here, then introduces you to him. Dr. Jekyll says:<br><br>"Pleased to meet Nezglekt's companions. I am Dr. Jekyll, lead and only researcher of this facility, dedicated to the study of the extraordinary capabilities of vampires.
e_court6_c_dsca=So, what brings you all here? Anything specific you'd like to report to me, Nezglekt?"
e_court8_nm=A place to rest
e_court8_dsc=You arrive at a quiet clearing where a few tents have already been set up. They are empty.
e_court8_dsca=It might be a good place to rest before continuing your journey.
e_court9_a_nm=Strange armor
e_court9_a_dsc=You arrive at the entrance of the castle. Strangely, there's no sign of guards or security.<br><br>Only scattered pieces of armor lie ahead, blocking the path. A faint fog clings to them, shifting ever so slightly in the breeze.<br><br>You'll need to clear the way to proceed.
e_court9_a_dsca=How do you want to handle this?
e_court9_b_nm=The armor destroyed
e_court9_b_dsc=After a hard-fought battle, the phantom armor lies still, and the path to the castle doors is finally clear.<br><br>Just as you're about to move on, something catches your eye: a chest tucked behind where the armor once stood.
e_court9_b_dsca=You're short on time... but a chest is a chest.
e_castle3_nm=The vampiric altar
e_castle3_dsc=You enter the altar room, dimly lit by countless flickering candles. At the far end stands an eerie, ancient altar radiating unsettling energy. A gnawing sense of dread tells you that using it may not be the wisest idea.
e_castle3_dsca=You hope that offering magic shards here might enhance your abilities.
e_castle4_nm=The well-kept library
e_castle4_dsc=You enter a surprisingly well-kept library. The shelves stretch high, crammed with books. A few lie open on a desk, like they were left in a hurry.
e_castle4_dsca=You've come this far into the castle… maybe now's not the time for reading. 
e_castle5_nm=The golden elixir
e_castle5_dsc=On the counter, several glass bottles gleam with golden, sparkling liquid.<br><br>It looks strangely inviting, maybe even helpful. But there could be a catch.<br><br>What if it's vampire juice? The kind that melts your insides if you're not undead?<br><br>Tempting… but risky.
e_castle5_dsca=What will you do?
e_castle6_nm=The lonesome boy
e_castle6_dsc=You step into a dusty storage room. Inside, a small lonesome boy is stacking boxes of first aid kits onto a high shelf. He freezes when he sees you, eyes wide with fear. Then quickly he bares his fangs, puffing his chest in an attempt to look tough.
e_castle6_dsca=You notice some of those kits could be useful…
e_castle9_nm=Calm before the storm
e_castle9_dsc=You feel the energy of the Obelisk pulsing from beyond the throne room.<br><br>This is your final moment of calm before what lies ahead.
e_castle9_dsca=Gather your strength. Whatever happens next, there's no turning back.
e_castle10_nm=The perfect vessel
e_castle10_dsc=You step into the throne room. The silence is suffocating, the darkness absolute. Near the Obelisk, something catches your eye: the princess, lying motionless in an open coffin. Yet… her chest rises and falls. She's alive.<br><br>Her hands hold a gem that you recognize as one of Hanshek's. As you move closer to have a better look, a ghostly apparition bursts forth from her body, and shrieks, “Don't you dare touch! I won't let you take even one step closer to the perfect vessel!”
e_castle10_dsca=Something is very wrong within these castle walls.
e_castle11_nm=The perfect vessel
e_castle11_dsc=You enter the throne room. It is eerily quiet and the Count is nowhere to be seen on the throne. Instead, there lies the body of the princess. It seems she is still alive…<br><br>As you make your way to the princess, a ghostly figure jumps out from the princess's body. The figure exclaims, “That’s my body! I won’t let you take even one step closer to the perfect vessel!”
e_castle11_dsca=Something sinister has been happening in the castle.
e_woods5_b_rp0=You don't have time for this.
e_woods5_b_rp0_s=The princess is out there, and every second counts. You will not waste time when the situation is dire.
e_woods5_b_rp1=Scavenge the swamp for useful items.
e_woods5_b_rp1_s=The bodies are strangely well-preserved, their weapons still lashed to arms, armor barely rusted.<br><br>You loot in silence, unnerved by how fresh the dead seem.<br><br>You find some useful items.
e_woods5_b_rp1_f=The corpses still bear arms, but the gear is cracked, rotted, or fused to flesh.<br><br>You find nothing of use.
e_woods5_b_rp1_sc=The monster corpses are pristine. You hesitate… then pull free a few gleaming weapons.<br><br>Either you're lucky, or something's deeply wrong.<br><br>You find some extraordinary items.
e_woods5_b_rp1_fc=The gear's broken, but you dig deeper, lifting rusted plates, shifting tangled limbs.<br><br>Then… slip! A heavy carcass tips, and the swamp answers with a foul, explosive splash.<br><br>You're drenched in noxious sludge. It stings your pride more than your skin.
e_woods5_b_rp2=There's something ominous about this place. Let's wait a little here.
e_woods5_b_rp2_s=The fog thickens as you linger, curling over the stones like a creeping spell. When the path all but vanishes, Nevermoor speaks again, voice low and grim:<br><br>“That explains the bodies. Nothing ominous... just cruel missteps.”<br><br>The party grumbles at the delay, but they feel that something about his words might hold a clue that may yet prove useful.
e_woods6_rp0=You ring the bell three times.
e_woods6_rp0_s=When the third bell rings, the souls of the architects gathered around you bow before you in thanks and disappear.

You are proud to have helped these souls in sorrow and thus completed Basthet's trial.

Laia is now free to leave her post and travel out of the desert.

You are proud to have helped these souls in sorrow and thus completed Basthet's trial.

Laia is now free to leave her post and travel out of the desert.
e_woods8_rp0=You are leaving since you don't have the key.
e_woods8_rp0_s=With no way to open the gate, you sigh and take the path around. The wind howls faintly behind you… almost as if mocking your retreat.
e_woods8_rp1=You use the black key in the lock.
e_woods8_rp1_s=The key slides in with a satisfying click. The ancient gates groan as they drift open, swaying gently in the wind.<br><br>You can now enter the cemetery.
e_woods8_rp2=You try to pick the lock somehow.
e_woods8_rp2_s=After careful tinkering, you hear a soft click. The gates creak open just enough to slip through.<br><br>You can now enter the cemetery.
e_woods8_rp2_f=You twist, prod, and poke, but the lock refuses to yield. Defeated, you stand and dust yourself off.<br><br>With no other choice, you leave disappointed and slightly embarrassed.
e_woods8_rp2_sc=After careful tinkering, you hear a click, but not just one. A hidden compartment pops open in the ironwork, revealing a small stash of glittering magic shards.<br><br>You can now enter the cemetery.
e_woods8_rp2_fc=After careful tinkering, you hear a promising click… then feel a surge of dark energy shoot through your arm. You leap back instinctively as the gate snaps shut again.<br><br>No serious harm done, but your hair might stand on end for a while.
e_woods8_rp3=I can try to pick the lock.
e_woods8_rp3_s=Sylvie steps forward, pulling a slender pick from her sleeve. With a quick flick of the wrist, the lock yields to her touch.<br><br>The gates swing open, whispering secrets to the wind.<br><br>You can now move south.
e_woods8_rp3_f=Sylvie steps forward, pulling a slender pick from her sleeve. She frowns as the lock refuses her efforts. She mutters something about “rusty junk.”<br><br>You have no choice but to leave, though Sylvie avoids eye contact for a while.
e_woods8_rp4=Hmm I think I could get us through…
e_woods8_rp4_s=Cornelius conjures a burst of searing magic. The iron melts away like wax under a candle flame, leaving a twisted opening just wide enough to pass through.<br><br>You can now enter the cemetery, though the air smells strongly of scorched metal and smug satisfaction.
e_woods9_rp0=You don't want to tempt fate.
e_woods9_rp0_s=You eye the pentagram warily and step back. Some doors are best left unopened.<br><br>You walk away.
e_woods9_rp1=Place one foot in the pentagram.
e_woods9_rp1_s=A chill rushes up your spine as the dark energy coils around you.<br><br>Your equipment shudders… and begins to change.
e_woods9_rp2=Stand in the center of the pentagram and try to earn a discount.

e_woods9_rp2_fc=The pentagram pulses violently. This wasn't a trade, it was a trap.<br><br>Your gear is corrupted… and prices rise by 30%.
e_woods9_rp3=Place the ingots in the pentagram to amplify the corruption.
e_woods9_rp3_s=You step into the circle and scatter the ingots. They tremble, then dissolve into the sigil. The dark energy howls with delight, engulfing you.<br><br>You can corrupt cards for free.
e_woods9_rp4=You use the corruption orb to empower the pentagram.
e_woods9_rp4_s=As you bring the orb closer, it begins to vibrate violently. The last of its power drains into the pentagram, which glows brighter and stronger. The orb crumbles to dust.<br><br>You can corrupt cards for free.
e_woods12_rp0=You enter the cave. The air crackles with static.
e_woods12_rp0_s=As you step inside, the hum grows louder.<br><br>You have a bad feeling about this. Whatever's down here doesn't want company.
e_woods13_rp0=You are not interested.
e_woods13_rp0_s=You nod politely and walk away.
e_woods13_rp1=You pay 1200g to make your pet stronger.
e_woods13_rp1_s=The witch chants softly, eyes closed. A shadowy swirl wraps around your pet, then vanishes.<br><br>Your pet has transformed.
e_woods13_rp2=Check out the creature cage.
e_woods13_rp2_s=The witch sweeps an arm toward the cage.<br><br>“Have a look,” she says. “Take the one that calls to you.”

e_woods14_a_rp2=I want to eat a fruit!

Soon the Woods will flourish into a vibrant forest again. You've done the right thing.<br><br>Bree can now return to the Senenthia forest, free of regret.

e_woods17_rp0_s=You slip into the courtyard. The guards snore on, blissfully unaware of your trespassing.
e_woods17_rp0_f=The armor clinking on your body makes a guard flinch in his sleep. A heavy mace slips from his hand and falls on your foot. Ouch…
e_woods17_rp1=I can try to put a sleeping curse on them for good measure.
e_woods17_rp1_s=This was a piece of cake for Zek. Nothing can wake up those guards until the curse wears off with time.

e_court6_a_rp0=You're not curious enough to give him your gold.
e_court6_a_rp0_s=You shake your head, mutter something about budget cuts, and walk out of the lab before he tries to invoice you.

e_court6_a_rp1_s=Dr. Jekyll strokes his tentacled chin.<br><br>"Fascinating... Did you know that vampires tend to drink a golden elixir? They believe it to boost their energy. But alas, it's a sham.

Well let me tell you some useful information. Did you know that the golden elixir you vampires tend to drink is a sham? You claim it boosts your energy, but the true secret lies in mixing it with powdered bark of the Elder Tree.”<br><br>He then hands you a pouch of the magic powder and then whispers in a low voice, "By the way, your father's activities have been a bit suspicious. I would be a bit careful around here if I were you."
e_court6_b_rp0=You prefer to ignore him and leave.
e_court6_b_rp0_s=You slip away, ignoring the scientist's expectant stare.

e_court6_b_rp1_s=Dr. Jekyll's snatches the delivery from your hands. “At last! My centrifuge-hydrator-barkifier is complete!”<br><br>He lets you see his new equipment and says, "Did you know that vampires tend to drink a golden elixir? They believe it to boost their energy. But alas, it's a sham. The true secret lies in mixing it with powdered bark of the Elder Tree.”<br><br>He then tosses you a pouch of the magic powder.<br><br>With the package delivered, Nezglekt is now free to roam once more.
e_court6_c_rp0=We're just passing through on our way to the castle.
e_court6_c_rp0_s=Dr. Jekyll tells you that since you are Nezglekt's companions he will share some findings that might be useful to you before you go.<br><br>"Did you know that vampires tend to drink a golden elixir?

e_court9_a_rp1=You try to rest and recover your strength.
e_court9_a_rp1_s=You settle down to rest, but an unease creeps over you. The armor stirs. One by one, the pieces begin to rattle, then rise.<br><br>You spring to your feet, ready to strike the phantom armor before it's too late.

e_court9_a_rp2_s=Thanks to what you read in the manuscript about a haunting spirit, you took precautions and cast a protective spell before settling in to rest.<br><br>Once rested, you approach the armor and your instincts were right.

e_court9_a_rp3=You can apply what we learned at the swamp.
e_court9_a_rp3_s=You remember how the fog drifted lazily through the swamp, cool and indifferent. This... isn't the same.<br><br>Your skin prickles. You recognize it for what it is, an evil presence! You ready yourself for battle.<br><br>The armor begins to tremble, then springs to life.

e_castle5_rp3=As Dr. Jekyll told you, you look for the magic powder to add to the drinks.
e_castle5_rp3_s=Cabinets, drawers, even under the sink, but no powder. You should've asked Dr. Jekyll where you could obtain it from.<br><br>Still, you find a few dusty crates of gold and settle with it. Something's better than nothing.
e_castle5_rp4=Pour the powder in the elixir bottle before drinking.
e_castle5_rp4_s=You mix in the powder. The liquid shimmers brighter. One gulp later, you feel a jolt of clarity and strength. Dr. Jekyll was right! (Initial Energy +1)

(Siren Queen) “That's right, my love. Let me deal with this one, just as I dealt with that rotten Hanshek.”<br><br>The siren begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp1=Beep... I must protect friends, beep... I must rescue princess.
e_castle10_rp1_s="An active war golem? Fascinating." The light spilling through the tall windows falls upon the throne, where the Count lounges in casual authority."This shouldn't trouble you, my dear?"<br><br>A silvery laugh dances in your ears. (Siren Queen) "Trouble me? Never. All of this is just another step toward my eternity with you, my love. Let me deal with him, just as I dealt with that rotten Hanshek."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle11_rp0=Prepare to fight.

e_castle6_rp3=Perhaps I can calm down the youngling.
e_castle6_rp3_s=The boy recoils at first, but Nevermoor kneels beside him, voice low and heavy with sorrow. "I know what it means to be afraid… and to be left behind."<br><br>Fear melts from the boy's face. Silently, he retrieves a medical kit from the shelf and offers it to you.<br><br>You use it to recover all your health.
e_castle6_rp4=Cousin! It's me, Velly! No need to be afraid.
e_castle6_rp4_s=The boy's expression instantly changes into a happy one. Then he begins to dramatically pound his little fists into Velarion's leg. "Velly! How could you! Don't go away for so long ever again! I don't know what I would do if I was to hear Uncle shouting one-two-one-two during dance practice once more!"<br><br>The boy calms down, "Uncle has been upto no good, Velly. He's locked himself in his room today. I can feel something's off. Here, maybe you should take this before you go to see him."<br><br>The little boy hands you a medical kit from the shelf. You use it to recover all your health.
e_woods16_a_nm=A failed experiment
e_woods16_a_dsc=After a brutal fight, Franky finally collapses. His hulking frame is still at last.<br><br>The strange metal blob bobs helplessly around his body, pitiful without its master.

e_court4_a_nm=Scrolls and scripts

e_castle4_a_nm=The well-kept library

e_court4_a_rp3=Read about an ancient ghost.
e_court4_a_rp3_s=You uncover a half-burnt manuscript tucked beneath the shelf, its pages brittle with age.<br><br>It speaks of a warrior cursed by a forbidden ritual, doomed to haunt the castle grounds, eternally reliving his final battle. Known to strike without warning, his blade is soaked in the pain of ten thousand deaths.<br><br>You leave the archive, unease trailing behind you.

e_court6_a_rp4_s=Dr. Jekyll grins with glee. “Such generosity from a fellow seeker of truth! Did you know that vampires tend to drink a golden elixir? They believe it to boost their energy.

e_sen25_a_rp18_s=Nevermoor begins the poetic tale of a man tormented by a midnight visitor, a black-winged omen whispering the same cryptic word over and over.<br><br>The werewolves are silent, drawn into the rhythm of his words until the last syllable fades. They then leave him in peace for the night.
e_sen25_a_rp18_f=Nevermoor launches into a long, tragic tale about the fall of his homeland and the betrayal of kin. The werewolves grow impatient with Nevermoor's brooding, muttering that they didn't ask for a funeral dirge. When he refuses to change his tone, the camp erupts into chaos.

e_sen25_a_rp19=I have many fun stories from back in the castle.
e_sen25_a_rp19_s=Velarion's voice drips with sardonic charm as he weaves tales of castle intrigue, forbidden magic, and narrow escapes.

e_sen29_a_rp3=A creature of blood? I think we'll understand each other just fine.
e_sen29_a_rp3_s=Velarion kneels, letting a drop of his blood roll down his palm. The blob quivers, then eagerly absorbs it, pulsing with faint light.<br><br>With a delighted ripple, it bounces to his side, and leads him to a corner with a few magic shards scattered about.

e_sen30_a_rp0_f=Velarion's spell unfortunately produces an awkward scatter of flames. Some flames land on the Trunkies. They take quick notice of you and charge straight at you.

e_sen31_a_rp6=A relic of the moon… such things were once mine to guard.
e_sen31_a_rp6_s=Nevermoor traces a sigil in the air. The magic seeps across the glade, curling around the altar. The moonstone slowly lifts from its place and drifts into his waiting hand, all without breaking the dryad's chant.

e_aquar24_a_rp9_f=Velarion took his time but was unable to decipher the mural correctly.<br><br>He speaks the words as best he can, but the symbols flare violently. A searing bolt of lightning explodes from a large rune, leaving him electrocuted.

It was my grand strategy to collect gold and avoid the frozen dead patrols. But who do you think you are to do this?"<br><br>Before he can continue, you slap him to make him shut up. Then the elf runs away crying like a child. Luckily for you, with the slap he dropped the bag with gold and shards.
e_faen33_a_rp9_f=Velarion casts a spell but fails to melt the ice.<br><br>The cold is too intense and you can not lose more time here.

e_sahti9_a_rp4=A blade? Hah… I need no weapon to spill blood.
e_sahti9_a_rp4_s=Velarion raises his hand, crimson energy spiraling as he draws a measure of his own blood into the air. The ghostly monkey watches, then bursts into manic laughter. "So… you are no stranger to the gift of exsanguination. We are alike, you and I!"<br><br>Velarion frowns at the monkey, while the rest of the party erupts in laughter. Still chuckling, the monkey bestows a blessing upon him before the entrance gradually begins to open.

e_sahti13_a_rp10=I know my way around blood… let me assist.
e_sahti13_a_rp10_s=The assistant nods to Velarion, and they enter the tent.<br><br>After a while, Velarion comes out and reports that his mastery of blood flow steadied the operation, allowing the surgeon to complete it with precision.<br><br>The commander, impressed, granted you access to the camp's arsenal and even his personal stash.
e_sahti13_a_rp10_f=The assistant nods to Velarion, and they enter the tent.<br><br>After a while, Velarion emerges, looking embarrassed. He admits that the sight of so much fresh human blood during the surgery stirred his hunger.<br><br>When he couldn't help but linger on it, the surgeon grew angry and ordered him out of the tent.

e_sahti13_a_rp11_f=The assistant allows Nevermoor inside.<br><br>After a while, he emerges looking awkward and embarrassed.

e_sahti22_a_rp27=Why don't vampires ever get sunburnt?
e_sahti22_a_rp27_s=(Velarion) "Because they always shade themselves with style."<br><br>The vampire delivered the punchline with a fanged grin. The pirates burst out laughing, some even slapping their knees at the wordplay. The judges are clearly amused and give Velarion a nine out of ten.<br><br>Velarion graciously accepts his prize.
e_sahti22_a_rp28=What do you call a pirate who outlives all his friends?
e_sahti22_a_rp28_s=(Nevermoor) "Lucky… until he realizes everyone he ever loved is gone, and the sea feels emptier every day."<br><br>An awkward silence follows, broken by a single uncomfortable cough. The judges exchange looks, then one mutters, “Bit dark, mate.” They still give him a six out of ten, reluctant to make the raven feel bad after his attempt.<br><br>Nevermoor accepts his prize with a dramatic sigh, as though the mediocre score is yet another tragedy in his long list of burdens.

e_lair7_a_rp5=I'll use a fire spell to scatter them.

e_sunken19_a_rp24=I can sever that web of energy before she binds herself forever.
e_sunken19_a_rp24_s=Nevermoor carves a glowing rune into the ground, and the web of energy around the altar snaps apart, halting the ritual.<br><br>As the dark energies fade away, the disappointed priestess turns to you, telling you that she was willing to sacrifice everything to end the Great Bird's tyranny, and now, thanks to your timely intervention, you have ruined her only chance to succeed.

What hope do I have for these?"<br><br>Nevermoor lowers his head and turns away. The party feels the weight of his grief, and although it pains them to leave the miners, they take advantage of the guards' distraction and slip deeper into the temple, unnoticed.

e_voidhigh6_a_rp8=I want to try red, green and blue.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp8_s=When you press the last rune, the magic circle lights up, but only for a brief second.<br><br>It seems like nothing of significance happened, except you feel satisfied you were able to act out safely on your intrusive thoughts.<br><br>You move on.

e_sen25_a_rp18=Very well... I have an interesting tale I can share with you all.
e_sen25_a_rp18_s=Nevermoor begins the poetic tale of a man tormented by a midnight visitor, a black-winged omen whispering the same cryptic word over and over.<br><br>The werewolves are silent, drawn into the rhythm of his words until the last syllable fades. They then leave him in peace for the night.
e_sen25_a_rp18_f=Nevermoor launches into a long, tragic tale about the fall of his homeland and the betrayal of kin. The werewolves grow impatient with Nevermoor's brooding, muttering that they didn't ask for a funeral dirge. When he refuses to change his tone, the camp erupts into chaos.

e_sen25_a_rp19=I have many fun stories from back in the castle.
e_sen25_a_rp19_s=Velarion's voice drips with sardonic charm as he weaves tales of castle intrigue, forbidden magic, and narrow escapes. Each story is tinged with danger and suspense.<br><br>The werewolves listen, rapt, some grinning, others glancing uneasily at one another. It was an enjoyable night.

e_sen29_a_rp3=A creature of blood? I think we'll understand each other just fine.
e_sen29_a_rp3_s=Velarion kneels, letting a drop of his blood roll down his palm. The blob quivers, then eagerly absorbs it, pulsing with faint light.<br><br>With a delighted ripple, it bounces to his side, and leads him to a corner with a few magic shards scattered about.

e_sen30_a_rp5_s=Velarion casts a fire spell, releasing a controlled burst of flames. The heat and light startle the Trunkies, sending them scrambling apart. With the path clear, you prepare for a much easier fight.
e_sen30_a_rp5_f=Velarion's spell unfortunately produces an awkward scatter of flames. Some flames land on the Trunkies. They take quick notice of you and charge straight at you.

e_sen31_a_rp6=A relic of the moon… such things were once mine to guard.
e_sen31_a_rp6_s=Nevermoor traces a sigil in the air. The magic seeps across the glade, curling around the altar. The moonstone slowly lifts from its place and drifts into his waiting hand, all without breaking the dryad's chant.

e_velka16_b_rp3=A book on ancient technology, you say? Sounds familiar.
e_velka16_b_rp3_s=(Velarion) “I may have read it once, in the castle's library. Whether I'll ever walk those halls again is… uncertain. Still, if I come across another copy, I'll see that it finds its way to you.”<br><br>The gnome blinks in suprise, telling you that it is difficult to find a book he has not seen… unless it lies in a place that can only be reached across the obelisks.<br><br>He thanks you for your willingness and gives you a few magic shards.<br><br>Before leaving, you rest a little in the camp.

e_aquar24_a_rp9_f=Velarion took his time but was unable to decipher the mural correctly.<br><br>He speaks the words as best he can, but the symbols flare violently. A searing bolt of lightning explodes from a large rune, leaving him electrocuted.

A smooth, dangerous voice answers as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>A silvery laugh dances in your ears. (Siren Queen) "Calm yourself, my love. This fool doesn't know it was Hanshek's doing. I merely cleaned up the mess so we would never be parted again, and now they stand here, ungrateful."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp4=Step aside, or my arrow finds your heart.
e_castle10_rp4_s="Confident, aren't we?" A smooth voice speaks as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority. "What do you think, my dear?"<br><br>The siren smirks. (Siren Queen) "I think he'll end up like Hanshek. Overconfident and underprepared. Nothing will stop me from spending eternity with you, my love."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp5=Sss... I usually only kill for work... sss... but this time I'm going to enjoy it.
e_castle10_rp5_s="I suspect I'll be the one enjoying this." A smooth, dangerous voice fills your ears as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>(Siren Queen) "That you will, my dear. Every obstacle brings us closer to our forever." She turns to you, "You should've stayed in your swamp. I'll send you somewhere far worse… like I did with Hanshek."<br><br>The siren begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp6=You! You're the one who brought that thing back, freezing my people!
e_castle10_rp6_s="You dare accuse my wife?" A smooth, dangerous voice answers as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>A silvery laugh dances in your ears. (Siren Queen) "Calm yourself, my love. This foolish elf doesn't know it was Hanshek's doing.

(Siren Queen) "Oh honey, I want to keep this one as a pet to entertain us in our endless years!" She turns to you, "Will you please sing for me, froggy? But first, let me deal with your threatening friends… just like I did with Hanshek."<br><br>The siren begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp8=Hanshek and I grew up together. He was like a big brother... Is this why he kidnapped the princess?
e_castle10_rp8_s="That would've made things easier, wouldn't it?" A smooth voice replies as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren tilts her head. (Siren Queen) "Your dear ‘brother' wanted her power. I simply realized she's the perfect vessel for my soul. I can finally live once again, and for eternity with my beloved. Now stand aside, I'm running out of time!"<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.

A smooth, dangerous voice responds as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>A silvery laugh dances in your ears. (Siren Queen) "You decrepit old man, maybe you should find a vessel of your own. I'd have spared Hanshek for you… but you're too late. Even you must see I would destroy entire worlds to stay by my beloved's side for eternity"<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp10=What an interesting place, can you explain what ritual you did to document it?
e_castle10_rp10_s="A gnome? How quaint." A smooth voice replies as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren sneers. (Siren Queen) "You interrupt my ritual that would have granted me an eternal life with my beloved and demand an explanation? Even Hanshek wasn't this arrogant. I'll end you before you can write another word."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp11=Interesting ritual happening here... but you're a fool and you'll find out soon enough.
e_castle10_rp11_s="I don't appreciate you speaking to my beloved like that." A smooth, dangerous voice cuts in as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority. "Shall I silence him, my dear?"<br><br>The siren smiles cruelly. (Siren Queen) "No need, my love. This rat knows nothing of real magic. I will gladly snuff out anyone who stands between us and our forever, just as I did with that arrogant Hanshek."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp12=What dark spell did you cast upon the princess? Step aside, I must heal her! 
e_castle10_rp12_s="Oh no, you must not." A smooth voice answers as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>A silvery laugh dances in your ears. (Siren Queen) "And I won't let you either! Your princess is a perfect vessel for my soul. I can finally live once again, and for eternity with my beloved. Now stand aside, I'm running out of time!"<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp13=Oink... I can feel that gem is bad news... you should get rid of it.
e_castle10_rp13_s="Bad news for you, piggy." A smooth, dangerous voice answers as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren scoffs at you. (Siren Queen) "The only thing I should get rid of is you, you ignorant swine! You interrupted my ritual that would have granted me an eternal life with my beloved. This gem is a vital piece, and you won't live to see the ritual complete."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp14=It's too late for you... that gem looks as if it has released a far greater evil.
e_castle10_rp14_s="Then you should know you've got no chance." A smooth, dangerous voice answers as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren sneers at you.

This gem is a vital piece, and you won't live to see the ritual complete."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp15=What a careless and foolish goal...
e_castle10_rp15_s="A squid? How unusual." A smooth voice answers as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren sneers. (Siren Queen) "Careless and foolish? You speak of yourself, alien. My love and I will soon be reunited for eternity, and you are nothing but another Hanshek to remove from our path."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp16=I could tell Hanshek was up to no good... but this looks far worse than I imagined.
e_castle10_rp16_s="Oh? Do you think so?" A smooth voice reaches your ears as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority. "Shall we show him, my dear?"<br><br>The siren smiles. (Siren Queen) "Hanshek underestimated me too. But my love, nothing will keep us apart. Not death, not time, and especially not fools like this one. Let me deal with them and soon we will be reunited for eternity."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp17=Basthet prepared me for this! She told me that one day I would triumph against the darkness!
e_castle10_rp17_s="How silly to think darkness can be so easily triumphed over." A smooth voice answers as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren smiles. (Siren Queen) "Your goddess cannot match my resolve, neither could that power-hungry Hanshek. I will tear down heavens and hells alike to live once again with my beloved."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp18=Thanks to the curse I am here today. To fight and stop you!
e_castle10_rp18_s=(Navalea) "Perhaps this was Basthet's intention all along... that I would be able to fight the Archons once again.<br><br>"One of the architects? Fascinating." A smooth voice reaches your ears as pale light spilling through the tall windows falls upon the throne, where the Count lounges in casual authority. "Do you need a hand here, my dear?"<br><br>The Siren shakes her head. (Siren Queen) "She wears her curse like armor. Mine is love itself, and I will see it endure when all else rots away. I will bring your downfall once more, just like I did for Hanshek."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp19=Return my daughter at once! You will pay for this!
e_castle10_rp19_s="Bold words, Your Majesty." A smooth voice replies as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren's lips curl. (Siren Queen) "There is room for only one queen here. I will reign eternal beside my love… and you, Amelia, will watch your crown sink into dust where Hanshek rests as well."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp20=You are an honourless queen! You will pay!
e_castle10_rp20_s="I don't appreciate you speaking to my beloved like that." A smooth, dangerous voice cuts in as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority. "Shall I silence him, my dear?"<br><br>The siren grins. (Siren Queen) "No need, my love. Honor feeds no heart. I fight for the only truth that matters, eternity with the one I love. I'll deal with him like I dealt with that arrogant Hanshek."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp21=Mmm… What a waste of talent. Give me that philosopher stone.
e_castle10_rp21_s="The what now?" A smooth voice replies as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren grins. (Siren Queen) "His science is only a distraction, my love. The true purpose of this stone that Hanshek also failed to realize was so I could forge eternity with my beloved."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp22=You will die by my hand, villain.
e_castle10_rp22_s="One other swore the same." A smooth voice muses as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority. "And we all know how he ended up."<br><br>A silvery laugh dances in your ears. (Siren Queen) "I have been dead too long. Now it's time I return to my beloved's side... for eternity."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp23=You are evil and cursed, and I will not let you succeed!
e_castle10_rp23_s="You're a bit too late." A smooth voice answers as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren sneers at you. (Siren Queen) "I have waited far too long to return to my beloved's side! You cannot stop me, nor could Hanshek. If my love is a curse, I will see the world drown in it."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp24=Mother? So… this is what all of father's schemes were for.
e_castle10_rp24_s="You see the truth now, my son." A smooth voice cuts in as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren's eyes are alight with triumph. (Siren Queen) "For years, all we sought was eternity together. Hanshek tried to stop us, now he sleeps beneath the waves. Join us, my son… or sink with the rest."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.
e_castle10_rp25=All these deaths… all this suffering, just to feed your own selfish desires.
e_castle10_rp25_s="That look is good on you, prince." A smooth voice murmurs as pale light spills across the throne, revealing the Count lounging with casual authority.<br><br>The siren smiles. (Siren Queen) "I will not apologize for any deaths, especially for the death of that power-hungry Hanshek. The world's pain is a fair price for my eternity together with my beloved."<br><br>She begins chanting, and in the blink of an eye, she vanishes, leaving behind familiar yet corrupted faces.

e_voidhigh13_a_rp24=I'll see every drop of power you've bled from this realm returned!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp24_s=(Hanshek) "You must be that prodigal whelp. I should have known you'd scurry out from the castle sooner or later. Your father doesn't care about you after all. <br><br>With what fate has in store for you, you waste your time on petty rebellion, boy. No matter… I'll drain you dry and add your strength to mine."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp25=Your corruption spreads like a plague. I'll take care of it before it rots another soul.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp25_s=(Hanshek) "Ah… the lost prince of the Dusk Lands! I see the curse has made you stronger than you ever were as a man. Have you been blaming yourself for the tragic fate of your kin? Well, let me tell you a little secret. Your crown, your people, even your soul… were simply pieces in my game.<br><br>Now, raven, I'll clip your wings myself."
e_castle4_rp8_s=Velarion has found a very interesting book that may be useful to him and decides to keep it.<br><br>It's time to move on.

//////DLC Threads of Dreams
e_dream6_nm=The Dream Mill
e_dream6_dsc=You come across an old windmill, but its blades spin without any wind.<br><br>As you get closer, you notice the mill isn't grinding grain – it's grinding dreams. Wisps of colored smoke pour from the windows, and you can hear the sound of sleeping people inside.<br><br>A sign by the door says "Sweet Dreams – 50 Gold Per Night." The miller appears to be asleep at his post, but his eyes are wide open and glowing.

e_dream6_rp1_sc=The miller blinks, and his eyes become normal. "My God, how long have I slept in this cursed trance? Thank you for freeing me! Now I can offer you real rest, not these artificial dreams."
e_dream6_rp1_s=The miller slowly comes to his senses. "I… I was trapped in my dreams. The mill feeds on dreams, but in return gives only illusions of peace. Be careful with its gifts."

e_dream11_nm=The Memory Lake
e_dream11_dsc=You come across a lake that doesn't reflect the sky.

e_dream3_nm=Dream Field
e_dream3_dsc=In the center of the field sits a young shepherd boy. He's muttering numbers to himself, eyes locked on the flock. "Thirty-one… no, forty-three… wait, it was sixty-eight…"<br><br>Each time — a different number. The sheep keep switching places, vanishing and reappearing. He doesn't notice you.

e_dream3_rp0_fc=You get stuck in a loop of eternal counting. "Welcome to my nightmare," says the shepherd sadly. Time flows, taking your strength while you count non-existent sheep.

e_dream3_rp1_sc=The shepherd blinks and his eyes clear. "I… I remember now! A witch cursed me for refusing to give her a sheep. Thank you for freeing me!" He tells you the secrets of the field and gives you a magic staff.
e_dream3_rp1_s=The shepherd slowly comes to his senses. "How long have I been here? Days? Years? This curse made me count sheep that don't exist. Thank you for the awakening."

e_dream3_rp2_fc=The attempt to leave the field activates its protective magic. The ground under your feet turns into a sticky dream swamp. "No one can just walk away from our game," giggles the sheep.

e_dream13_a_dsc=You stand before ancient obelisks wreathed in swirling dream-mist. At their base, the Reweaver channels dark magic, his hands weaving corrupted patterns in the air. The stolen Dream Veil hovers above him, pulsing with stolen power.<br><br>The Reweaver is deep in concentration, unaware of your presence. This ritual seems crucial — if completed, it could merge the dream realm with reality permanently. You have moments to decide your approach before he notices you.

e_dream13_a_rp0="We need to heal and prepare before facing him."
e_dream13_a_rp0_s=<color=#333>(Reweaver)</color>:"You all think your preparation will save you? I've had centuries to perfect this ritual!"
e_dream13_a_rp0_f=<color=#333>(Reweaver)</color>:"Too late! The ritual nears completion. Your group's feeble efforts mean nothing!"
e_dream13_a_rp1="Strike now while he's distracted! Don't let him finish the ritual!"
e_dream13_a_rp1_s=<color=#333>(Reweaver)</color>:"What?! You dare interrupt the great weaving together? I still have enough power to finish it!"
e_dream13_a_rp1_f=<color=#333>(Reweaver)</color>:"Foolish mortals! Your desperate attack only hastens the ritual. Reality bends to my will, not yours!"
e_dream13_a_rp2="Watch his patterns. Learn his weaknesses before we attack."
e_dream13_a_rp2_s=<color=#333>(Reweaver)</color>:"You observe carefully… but none of you truly understand."
e_dream13_a_rp2_f=<color=#333>(Reweaver)</color>:"Your minds are too small, too limited — none of you can grasp the complexity of my design!"
e_dream13_a_rp3=Let me disrupt his ritual with counter-magic.
e_dream13_a_rp3_s=<color=#333>(Nirada)</color>:"Impossible… those techniques were lost… You cannot"

e_dream13_a2_dsc=The Reweaver is gone, his body dissolving into dream mist.

e_dream13_b_nm=Shattered Veil
e_dream13_b_dsc=The Dream Veil glows in your hands, mending the broken barrier between worlds.<br><br>A glowing bridge now connects the dream and reality worlds. Destroy the Dream Veil to break the bridge — no more invasions, but the worlds stay apart. Or let the bridge stand — and live with the consequences. The bridge pulses.
e_dream13_b_dsca=What will you choose?
e_dream13_b_rp0="The bridge is too dangerous. Destroy it."
e_dream13_b_rp0_s=The bridge is destroyed. The dream realm fades, and silence settles over the land.
e_dream13_b_rp1=Trust the Dreamweavers. Keep the bridge.
e_dream13_b_rp1_s=The bridge is preserved. Dreams may now flow freely into reality.
e_dream13_b_rp2=End it now, before more corruption spreads.
e_dream13_b_rp2_s=The bridge is destroyed by Magnus’s will. No one speaks as the veil vanishes.
e_dream13_b_rp3=Some risks are worth taking.
e_dream13_b_rp3_s=The bridge is preserved. Hope outweighs fear — for now.
e_dream13_b_rp4=Shared knowledge could benefit all.
e_dream13_b_rp4_s=The bridge is preserved. Runes of protection are etched into its base.
e_dream13_b_rp5=Dreams lie. They show you what you want, not what is. I've seen illusions ruin good people. End it.
e_dream13_b_rp5_s=The bridge is destroyed. Reality and the dream realm are forever separated.
e_dream13_b_rp6=We were given this bridge for a reason. I won't let fear decide our future.
e_dream13_b_rp6_s=The bridge is preserved. Nirada swears to guard it and guide others through its wonders.

e_faen44_nm=The Dream Portal
e_faen44_dsc=A swirling purple portal appears before you, emanating a strange, shimmering mist. The air around it feels different — lighter, as if reality itself has grown thin. Through the portal's depths, you catch glimpses of impossible colors and shifting shapes that seem to bend and flow like liquid light.<br><br>Something about this gateway feels otherworldly, as though it leads not to another place, but to somewhere beyond the normal rules of existence. The mist that drifts from its edges carries an odd, dreamlike quality that makes you question what is real and what is not.
e_faen44_dsca=Do you dare step through into the unknown?
e_faen44_rp0=Cross the purple portal, from which the mysterious fog comes out.
